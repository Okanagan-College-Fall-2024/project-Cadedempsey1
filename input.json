      "content": "Case Study - Negotiating Bankruptcy - Page 1 of 3 \nNegotiating Bankruptcy \n \nJohn Gellene, a bankruptcy lawyer at the law firm Milbank Tweed, worked directly under Wall Street \nattorney Larry Lederman. In 1994, Lederman asked Gellene to represent mining equipment company \nBucyrus-Erie (BE) in a reorganization bankruptcy that became increasingly complicated. \n \nIn an attempt to initially ward off bankruptcy, BE had, pursuant to the legal advice of Milbank Tweed \nand the financial advice of Goldman Sachs, accepted a $35 million infusion of cash from an investment \nfund called South Street. In exchange, BE gave South Street a lien on all of the company's \nmanufacturing equipment, putting it ahead of other BE creditors, including Jackson National Life (JNL). \nJNL was BE's largest single creditor, but was unsecured. BE had posted no collateral in return for JNL's \nloan, so JNL was in line in bankruptcy court behind all of BE's creditors that had demanded collateral. \nSouth Street was controlled by Mikael Salovaara, a former Goldman Sachs banker who had previously \nprovided financial advice to BE and was advised by Lederman. \n \nWhen Gellene filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition on behalf of BE, he was required to ask the court \nto appoint him and Milbank Tweed as BE's counsel for purposes of the proceedings. At that time, he \nfiled documents under oath that were supposed to disclose any potential conflicts of interest that \nMilbank Tweed had in the proceedings.  For reasons unknown, Gellene did not disclose to the \nbankruptcy judge (who would appoint counsel) the fact that Milbank Tweed was representing both \nSouth Street and Salovaara regarding various matters. \n \nLegal scholars and attorneys reflecting on this case years later have speculated as to why Gellene did \nnot disclose what might seem to be obvious connections that could be potential conflicts of interest for \nMilbank Tweed. Lawyer Steve Sather suggests that the lack of disclosure may have been inadvertent, \nor that Gellene did not see the connections as inherent conflicts, among other possible reasons. \n \nRegardless, Gellene did successfully guide BE through the \nreorganization process. The failure to disclose was not \ndiscovered until years later by JNL, which then sued Milbank \nTweed. Criminal charges were filed against Gellene for three \nfelony counts of making false statements under oath in regard \nto Milbank Tweed's ability to serve as bankruptcy counsel. \nGellene was convicted and sent to prison for 15 months. \n  \nResources:\n \nBlind Spots: Why We Fail to Do What's Right and What to Do About It \nhttp://www.worldcat.org/title/blind-spots-why-we-fail-to-do-whats-right-and-what-to-do-about-\nit/oclc/679940661 \n \nBehavioral Business Ethics: Shaping an Emerging Field \nhttp://www.worldcat.org/title/behavioral-business-ethics-shaping-an-emerging-field/oclc/654316608 \n \n\n \nCase Study - Negotiating Bankruptcy - Page 3 of 3 \nMilbank, Tweed Is Accused of a Conflict \nhttp://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/28/business/milbank-tweed-is-accused-of-a-conflict.html \n \nEat What You Kill: The Fall of a Wall Street Lawyer \nhttp://www.worldcat.org/title/eat-what-you-kill-the-fall-of-a-wall-street-lawyer/oclc/649743120 \n \nConfidence Games: Lawyers, Accountants, And The Tax Shelter Industry \nhttp://www.worldcat.org/title/confidence-games-lawyers-accountants-and-the-tax-shelter-\nindustry/oclc/861966361 \n \nObstacles to Ethical Decision-Making: Mental Models, Milgram and the Problem of Obedience \nhttp://www.worldcat.org/title/obstacles-to-ethical-decision-making-mental-models-milgram-and-the-\nproblem-of-obedience/oclc/809926073 \n \nThe Sad Case of John Gellene or What It Feels Like to Get Hit By Lightning  \nhttp://stevesathersbankruptcynews.blogspot.com/2006/07/sad-case-of-john-gellene-or-what-it.html \n \n \nAuthor: \nRobert Prentice, J.D. \nDepartment of Business, Government and Society \nMcCombs School of Business \nThe University of Texas at Austin",
      "questions": [
        "1) What concepts from the video Intro to Behavioral Ethics are apparent in this case study?",
        "2) Why might the connections among Milbank Tweed, South Street, and Salovaara be conflicts of interest? Why not? Explain your reasoning.",
        "3) Does it seem irrational for an attorney who has a very promising legal career to not disclose potential conflicts of interest? If you were in Gellene's position, what would you have done? Why?",
        "4) At sentencing, the prosecutor in the Gellene criminal case said that he had prosecuted many bad people over the years, but admitted John Gellene isn't a bad guy. The prosecutor said it made him nauseous to see how hard Gellene had been working and suggested that Gellene was overstressed and overworked. Is that an explanation for Gellene's actions in the BE reorganization? Why or why not?",
        "5) Gellene had opportunities to correct his errors before they came to light, but did not. How would you evaluate the following statement from Gellene: I've been recognized as a person with gifts in terms of my intellect and my ability to deal with problems and I've been very good and very competent at the kinds of problems presented [by] my clients in the practice of law... And that is I think such a part of me and who I hold myself out to be and who I am that when I am confronted with a mistake, an act of inadvertence that is stupid that I'm--it is very difficult for me to stand up and say I did a stupid thing.",
        "6) What do you think of the following statement by the judge in the Gellene criminal case: I have a substantial amount of contact with my colleagues in law firms to appreciate that there are incredible pressures in this area that, frankly, sooner rather than later are going to have to be addressed or we are going to see more cases of this nature being prosecuted for criminal conduct because lawyers are so focused on other matters... [W]hen they become so focused to the exclusion of ethical considerations, that is when the entire system breaks down, the public at large is ever more distrustful.",
        "7) Based on the two statements above, where do you think the blame primarily lies and why? With Gellene individually, or with the system within which he operated? Explain your reasoning."

      "content": "Case Study - German Police Battalion 101 - Page 1 of 2 \nGerman Police Battalion 101 \n \nDuring the Holocaust, more than a third of Nazi Germany's Jewish victims never boarded deportation \ntrains and did not die in gas chambers. Jewish men, women, and children were murdered near their \nhomes in surrounding fields and forests by German police forces and their local helpers. Historians \nestimate that these so-called mobile killing units shot almost 2 million people during World War II. \nAfter the war, when some of the shooters and their commanders were put on trial, they claimed that \nthey had to follow orders. Decades later, however, historians studying the interrogation files of one of \nthese police battalions made a startling discovery. Not only did many ordinary Germans participate in \nthe mass murder of Jews, they did so voluntarily. \n \nIn his book on one group of reserve policemen from the German city Hamburg, Ordinary Men: Reserve \nPolice Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland, historian Christopher Browning shows that while \nthe men were expected to follow orders when it came to killing civilians, they could have refused to do \nso. In July 1942, before their induction into the mass shooting of civilians in the small Polish town of \nJozefow, their commander gave battalion members a choice. If any of the men were not up to the \ntask, they would be assigned to do other duties, such as guarding or transportation. When given the \nopportunity to opt out, only a very small number of men did. Even though this option remained in the \nmonths that followed, the majority of reserve policemen chose to kill--to do the dirty work even if \njust for a short time before being relieved of duty--rather than separate themselves from their unit by \nrefusing to murder civilians. \n \nMost of these ordinary, middle-aged German men became willing, although not enthusiastic, killers. A \nsmall minority consistently excused themselves from the task at hand. Those that killed, Browning \nargues, did so because of the pressure for conformity--the \nbasic identification of men in uniform with their comrades and \nthe strong urge not to separate themselves from the group by \nstepping out... [The] act of stepping out...meant leaving one's \ncomrades and admitting that one was 'too weak' or 'cowardly'. \n \n \nResources:\n \nOrdinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland \nhttp://www.worldcat.org/title/ordinary-men-reserve-police-battalion-101-and-the-final-solution-in-\npoland/oclc/24010495 \n \nThe Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil \nhttp://www.worldcat.org/title/lucifer-effect-understanding-how-good-people-turn-evil/oclc/70839827 \n \n \nAuthor: \nTatjana Lichtenstein, Ph.D. \nDepartment of History \nCollege of Liberal Arts \nThe University of Texas at Austin",

      "content": "Case Study - Krogh & the Watergate Scandal - Page 1 of 3 \nKrogh & the Watergate Scandal \n \n \nEgil Bud Krogh was a young lawyer who worked for the Nixon administration in the late 1960s and \nearly 1970s as deputy assistant to the president. Military analyst Daniel Ellsberg leaked the Pentagon \nPapers, which contained sensitive information regarding the United States' progress in the Vietnam \nWar. President Nixon himself tasked Krogh with stopping leaks of top-secret information.  And Nixon's \nAssistant for Domestic Affairs, John Ehrlichman, instructed Krogh to investigate and discredit Ellsberg, \ntelling Krogh that the leak was damaging to national security. \n \nKrogh and another staffer assembled a covert team that became known as the plumbers (to stop \nleaks), which was broadly supervised by Ehrlichman. In September 1971, the plumbers' first break-in \nwas at the office of Ellsberg's psychiatrist; they were looking for documents that would discredit \nEllsberg based on mental health. Reflecting on the meeting in which the break-in was proposed and \napproved, Krogh later wrote, I listened intently. At no time did I or anyone else there question \nwhether the operation was necessary, legal or moral. Convinced that we were responding legitimately \nto a national security crisis, we focused instead on the operational details: who would do what, when \nand where. \n \nThe break-in, which was illegal, was also unproductive. Nothing was found to discredit Ellsberg. \nImportantly, the ties between this break-in and Nixon were much more direct and easy to establish \nthan the ties between Nixon and the Watergate break-in.  Krogh later pled guilty to his role in the \nbreak-in and was sentenced to two-to-six years in prison. At his sentencing, Krogh explained that \nnational security is subject to a wide range of definitions, a factor that makes all the more essential a \npainstaking approach to the definition of national security in any given instance. Judge Gesell, \nsentencing Krogh to serve six months in prison and remain on unsupervised probation for another two \nyears, said, In acknowledging your guilt, you have made no effort, as you very well might have, to \nplace the primary blame on others who initiated and who approved the undertaking. A wholly \nimproper, illegal task was assigned to you by higher authority and you carried it out because of a \ncombination of loyalty and I believe a degree of vanity, thereby compromising your obligations as a \nlawyer and a public servant.  \n \nKrogh, who cooperated with the Watergate prosecutors and never bargained for leniency, served only \nfour-and-a-half months of his sentence. The Washington State Supreme Court disbarred Krogh in 1975, \nalthough he successfully petitioned to be reinstated in 1980 and became partner in the Seattle law firm \nKrogh & Leonard. Krogh has spent much of the past 45 years \nsupporting legal ethics education and writing and lecturing on the \ntopic of integrity. Writing for The New York Times in 2007, he \nstated, I finally realized that what had gone wrong in the Nixon \nWhite House was a meltdown in personal integrity. Without it, we \nfailed to understand the constitutional limits on presidential \npower and comply with statutory law. \n \n \n\n \nCase Study - Krogh & the Watergate Scandal - Page 2 of 3",

      "content": "Case Study - Apple Suppliers & Labor Practices- Page 1 of 2 \nApple Suppliers & Labor Practices \n \nWith its highly coveted line of consumer electronics, Apple has a cult following among loyal consumers. \nDuring the 2014 holiday season, 74.5 million iPhones were sold. Demand like this meant that Apple \nwas in line to make over $52 billion in profits in 2015, the largest annual profit ever generated from a \ncompany's operations. Despite its consistent financial performance year over year, Apple's robust \nprofit margin hides a more complicated set of business ethics. Similar to many products sold in the \nU.S., Apple does not manufacture most its goods domestically. Most of the component sourcing and \nfactory production is done overseas in conditions that critics have argued are dangerous to workers \nand harmful to the environment.  \n \nFor example, tin is a major component in Apple's products and much of it is sourced in Indonesia. \nAlthough there are mines that source tin ethically, there are also many that do not. One study found \nworkers--many of them children--working in unsafe conditions, digging tin out by hand in mines \nprone to landslides that could bury workers alive. About 70% of the tin used in electronic devices such \nas smartphones and tablets comes from these more dangerous, small-scale mines. An investigation by \nthe BBC revealed how perilous these working conditions can be. In interviews with miners, a 12-year-\nold working at the bottom of a 70-foot cliff of sand said: I worry about landslides. The earth slipping \nfrom up there to the bottom. It could happen. \n \nApple defends its practices by saying it only has so much control over monitoring and regulating its \ncomponent sources. The company justifies its sourcing practices by saying that it is a complex process, \nwith tens of thousands of miners selling tin, many of them through middle-men. In a statement to the \nBBC, Apple said the simplest course of action would be for Apple to unilaterally refuse any tin from \nIndonesian mines. That would be easy for us to do and would certainly shield us from criticism. But \nthat would also be the lazy and cowardly path, since it would do nothing to improve the situation. We \nhave chosen to stay engaged and attempt to drive changes on the ground. \n \nIn an effort for greater transparency, Apple has released annual reports detailing their work with \nsuppliers and labor practices. While more recent investigations have shown some improvements to \nsuppliers' working conditions, Apple continues to face criticism as consumer demand for iPhones and \nother products continues to grow. \n \n \n \n\n \nCase Study - Apple Suppliers & Labor Practices- Page 2 of 2 \nResources:\nApple 'failing to protect Chinese factory workers' \nhttp://www.bbc.com/news/business-30532463 \nHow Apple could make a $53 billion profit this year \nhttp://money.cnn.com/2015/07/17/technology/apple-earnings-2015/ \nGlobal Apple iPhone sales from 3rd quarter 2007 to 2nd quarter 2016 (in million units)  \nhttp://www.statista.com/statistics/263401/global-apple-iphone-sales-since-3rd-quarter-2007/ \nDespite successes, labor violations still haunt Apple \nhttp://www.theverge.com/2015/2/12/8024895/apple-slave-labor-working-conditions-2015 \nReports - Supplier Responsibility - Apple \nhttps://www.apple.com/supplier-responsibility/progress-report/ \n \n \nAuthor: \nLucy Atkinson, Ph.D. \nStan Richards School of Advertising & Public Relations \nMoody College of Communication \nThe University of Texas at Austin",

He began his career at Tyco International in 1975 \nas an auditor, and worked his way up the corporate ladder to become CEO in 1992. Kozlowski gained \nnotoriety as CEO for the rapid growth and success of the company, as well as his extravagant lifestyle. \nHe left the company in 2002 amid controversy surrounding his compensation and personal spending. \nIn 2005, Kozlowski was convicted of crimes in relation to alleged unauthorized bonuses of $81 million, \nin addition to other large purchases and investments. \n \nAs CEO, Kozlowski was lauded for his risk-taking and the immense growth of the company. He \nlaunched a series of strategic mergers and acquisitions, rapidly building up the size of Tyco. During his \nfirst six years as CEO, he secured 88 deals worth over $15 billion. Strong growth was bolstered by a \nbooming economy, and Tyco's stock price soared as the company consistently beat Wall Street's \nexpectations. However, when the economy slowed, the company began to struggle. \n \nAllegedly, Tyco paid for Kozlowski's $30 million New York apartment, as well as personal gifts and \nparties, including $1 million of a $2 million birthday party for his wife. After Kozlowski paid a $20 \nmillion finding fee to a board member without proper approval, and paintings invoiced for Tyco offices \nended up in Kozlowski's apartment (among other irregularities), Kozlowski was criminally charged with \nlooting more than $600 million of assets from Tyco and its shareholders. \n \nWhile many questioned his lifestyle, others questioned the trial and conviction.

      "title": "The-Costco-Model",
      "content": "Case Study - Negotiating Bankruptcy - Page 1 of 3 \nThe Costco Model \n \nCostco is often cited as one of the world's most ethical companies. It has been called a testimony to \nethical capitalism in large part due to its company practices and treatment of employees. Costco \nmaintains a company code of ethics which states, The continued success of our company depends on \nhow well each of Costco's employees adheres to the high standards mandated by our Code of Ethics... \nBy always choosing to do the right thing, you will build your own self-esteem, increase your chances for \nsuccess and make Costco more successful, too. \n \nIn debates over minimum wage in the United States, many commentators see Costco as an example of \nhow higher wages can yield greater company success, often pointing to competitors such as Walmart \nand Target as examples that fall short in providing for their employees. Other commentators do not \nsee Costco's model as being easily replicable for different types of businesses, citing wages as only one \nof many factors to consider in companies' best practices. \n \nCostco tends to pay around 40% more and provides more comprehensive health and retirement \nbenefits than Walmart and Target, saving large amounts in employee turnover costs. The company \nresists layoffs, invests in training its employees, and grants them substantial autonomy to solve \nproblems. U.S. Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez stated, And the remarkable loyalty that [employees] \nhave to [Costco cofounder Jim Sinegal] is a function of the fact that he categorically rejects the notion \nthat, 'I either take care of my shareholders or my workers.' That is a false choice. \n \nWhile few disagree with the benefits of fair treatment of employees, some commentators credit the \nsuccess of Costco to its broader business model that favors higher productivity, not employee \nsatisfaction. Columnist and economist Megan McArdle explains, A typical Costco store has around \n4,000 SKUs [stock keeping units], most of which are stacked on pallets so that you can be your own \nstockboy. A Walmart has 140,000 SKUs, which have to be tediously sorted, replaced on shelves, \nreordered, delivered, and so forth. People tend to radically underestimate the costs imposed by \ncomplexity, because the management problems do not simply add up; they multiply. Furthermore, \nMcArdle notes that Costco mainly serves as a grocer rather than department store and caters to a \ngenerally affluent customer base in suburban areas. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nCase Study - Negotiating Bankruptcy - Page 2 of 3 \nResources:\n \nUnselfishness: The World's Most Ethical Company & Why Collaboration Works \nhttp://www.rohitbhargava.com/2012/05/unselfishness-the-worlds-most-ethical-company-why-\ncollaboration-works.html \n \nHow Costco Became the Anti-Wal-Mart \nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/17/business/yourmoney/how-costco-became-the-\nantiwalmart.html \n \nConnecting the Dots Between Leadership, Ethics and Corporate Culture \nhttp://iveybusinessjournal.com/publication/connecting-the-dots-between-leadership-ethics-and-\ncorporate-culture/ \n \nWhy Be an Ethical Company?

      "content": "Case Study - Artic Offshore Drilling - Page 1 of 2 \nArctic Offshore Drilling \n \nOffshore oil and gas reserves, primarily along coastlines in Alaska, California, Louisiana, and Texas, \naccount for a large proportion of the oil and gas supply in the United States. In August 2015, President \nObama authorized Royal Dutch Shell to expand drilling off Alaska's northwest coast. His decision \nbrought into sharp relief the different, oftentimes competing views on the expansion of offshore \ndrilling.  \n \nMany proponents of offshore drilling argue that tapping into the vast amount of oil and gas reserves in \nthe Arctic will help shore up national security interests for the United States, bolster its economy and \nworkforce, and offer Americans a reliable, safe supply of oil. According to Robert Bryce, senior fellow \nat the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, there are enormous amounts of recoverable energy \nresources in the Arctic. The Department of Energy estimates them at something on the order of 400 \nbillion barrels of oil equivalent in natural gas and oil. That's four times the crude oil reserves of \nKuwait. Framed this way, drilling in the Arctic presents a way for Americans to mitigate risks from \ndependence on foreign oil and build the local and national economies by creating jobs and supplying \ncheap oil. \n \nA competing point of view charges that offshore oil drilling poses immense risk to the environment \nwhile reinforcing a reliance on dirty, environmentally unfriendly sources of energy. Critics claim that \nindustrial activity associated with offshore drilling in the Arctic could harm native animals, including \npolar bears, walruses, seals, and whales already jeopardized by climate warming and declining levels of \nsea ice. Environmentalists argue that oil companies have not demonstrated the capability to clean up \nan oil spill in water obstructed by ice. Furthermore, they contend, extracting oil only perpetuates a \nfossil-fuel economy and will contribute dangerously to rising global temperature thereby exacerbating \nclimate change.  \n \nGranting Shell the permit to drill in the Arctic was the \nwrong decision, and this fight is far from over, said \nMichael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club. The \npeople will continue to call on President Obama to \nprotect the Arctic and our environment. \n \nResources:\n \nObama's Alaska controversies: Denali, oil drilling, climate change \nhttp://www.mercurynews.com/nation-world/ci_28732579/obamas-alaska-controversies-denali-oil-\ndrilling-climate-change \n \nDoes allowing Arctic offshore drilling undermine Obama's climate efforts? \nhttp://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/allowing-arctic-offshore-drilling-undermine-obamas-climate-\nefforts/ \n \nU.S. lets Shell drill for oil off Alaska \nhttp://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2015/08/17/shell-arctic-alaska/31890239/ \n \nFeds allow Shell to drill for oil in Arctic Ocean off Alaska \nhttp://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/environment/feds-allow-shell-to-drill-for-oil-in-arctic-\nocean-off-alaska/ \n \nAuthor: \nLucy Atkinson, Ph.D. \nStan Richards School of Advertising & Public Relations \nMoody College of Communication \nThe University of Texas at Austin",

And we have laws against selling drugs, pushing drugs, using drugs, \nimporting drugs.

Limbaugh illegally purchased hundreds of prescription pills per month over a period \nof several years. He engaged in the practice of doctor shopping by visiting different doctors to obtain \nmultiple prescriptions for drugs that would otherwise be illegal. When this was disclosed, Limbaugh \nchecked into a treatment facility. He said, Over the past several years I have tried to break my \ndependence on pain pills and, in fact, twice checked myself into medical facilities in an attempt to do \nso.... I have recently agreed with my physician about the next \nsteps. \n \nThough doctor shopping was punishable by up to five years in \nprison under Florida law, charges against Limbaugh were \ndropped after he sought help and agreed to the prosecutors' \nsettlement.

Barron's \nadministration viewed his history lesson as racist. While teaching about racial segregation laws during \nthe Jim Crow era, Barron played a video showing a white entertainer in blackface. During the \nnineteenth and early twentieth century, white actors commonly painted their faces with makeup to \ndepict black individuals. Barron explained that the purpose of the video was to show how stereotypes \nof African-Americans were portrayed at one point in American history.

Chronically underfunded, the agency was having difficulty \nproviding care in a timely manner. At various locations around the country, veterans were put on \nlengthy wait lists before they could receive care. \n \nTurning to a common private sector solution in an attempt to reduce wait times, the VA provided \nbonuses to administrators who could reduce veterans' wait times for doctor and hospital \nappointments. While these incentives were meant to spur more efficient and productive health care \nfor veterans, not all administrators complied as intended. \n \nIn one hospital, the goal was to reduce wait times to less than 14 days. Clerks would record a wait time \nof how many days there would be between the first available appointment date and the veteran's \nscheduled appointment date, disregarding any days prior to the first available date. In an email to \ncolleagues, the clerk admitted, Yes, it is gaming the system a bit. But you have to know the rules of \nthe game you are playing, and when we exceed the 14-day measure, the front office gets very upset. \n \nAt some locations, veterans were put on an electronic waiting list. After waiting for up to six weeks to \nmove to the top of that list, they were finally able to call for a doctor's appointment. If that \nappointment occurred soon after the call, it was counted as reducing the wait time; the time spent on \nthe preliminary electronic waiting list was not counted. At other locations, VA officials used two sets of \nbooks, one recording the real wait times and another recording much shorter wait times that would be \nused to report success to superiors. \n \nUsing these and other maneuvers, executives in the VA \nqualified for millions of dollars of bonuses, even though \nactual wait times continued to lengthen.

As part of the investigation, the FBI \nattempted to gain access to the data stored on the phone but was unable to penetrate its encryption \nsoftware. Lawyers for the Obama administration approached Apple for assistance with unlocking the \ndevice, but negotiations soon broke down. The Justice Department then obtained a court order \ncompelling Apple to help the FBI unlock the phone. Apple CEO, Timothy Cook, publicly challenged the \ncourt in an open letter, sparking an intense debate over the balance between maintaining national \nsecurity and protecting user privacy. \n \nApple and its supporters, including top technology companies such as Google and Facebook, made the \ncase on several fronts that the court order threatened the privacy of all individuals. First, according to \nApple, the order effectively required the company to write code, violating its First Amendment right to \nfree speech by forcing the company to say something it did not want to say. Previous court cases had \nalready established computer code as legally protected speech. Second, such a backdoor, once \ncreated, could fall into the wrong hands and threaten the privacy of all iPhone owners. Finally, it would \nset a dangerous precedent; law enforcement could repeatedly require businesses such as Apple to \nassist in criminal investigations, effectively making technology companies an agent of government. \n \nRepresentatives from both sides of the political aisle offered several arguments in favor of the Justice \nDepartment's efforts and against Apple's stance. Their central claim was that the U.S. legal system \nestablishes constraints on the government's access to private information which prevent abuse of \nsearch and surveillance powers. At the same time, the law still allows authorities to gain access to \ninformation that facilitates prevention and prosecution of criminal activities, from terrorism to drug \ntrafficking to child pornography. Critics of Apple also rejected the slippery slope argument on the \ngrounds that, if Apple cooperated, it could safeguard the code it created and keep it out of the hands \nof others, including bad actors such as terrorists or criminal groups. Moreover, Apple was accused of \nbeing too interested in protecting its brand, and even unpatriotic for refusing to comply with the court \norder. \n \nUltimately, the FBI dropped the case because it was able to circumvent the encryption on the iPhone \nwithout Apple's help. \n \n \n \n \n\n \nCase Study - The FBI & Apple: Security vs. Privacy - Page 2 of 3 \nResources:\n \nApple Fights Order to Unlock San Bernardino Gunman's iPhone \nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/18/technology/apple-timothy-cook-fbi-san-bernardino.html \n \nHow they line up on Apple vs. the FBI  \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/business/fbi-apple/ \n \nWhy Apple Is Right to Challenge an Order to Help the F.B.I. \nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/19/opinion/why-apple-is-right-to-challenge-an-order-to-help-the-\nfbi.html \n \nApple's Rotten Core: CEO Tim Cook's Case for Not Aiding the FBI's Antiterror Effort Looks Worse than \nEver \nhttp://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-rotten-core-1456696736 \n \n\n \nCase Study - The FBI & Apple: Security vs. Privacy - Page 3 of 3 \nObama, at South by Southwest, Calls for Law Enforcement Access in Encryption Fight \nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/12/us/politics/obama-heads-to-south-by-southwest-festival-to-\ntalk-about-technology.html \n \nU.S. Says It Has Unlocked iPhone Without Apple \nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/29/technology/apple-iphone-fbi-justice-department-\ncase.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=first-column-\nregion&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news \n \n \nAuthors: \nRobert Moser, Ph.D. and Patrick McDonald, Ph.D. \nDepartment of Government \nCollege of Liberal Arts \nThe University of Texas at Austin",

      "content": "Case Study - The Collapse of Barings Bank - Page 1 of 2 \nThe Collapse of Barings Bank \n \nFounded in 1762, Barings Bank was a United Kingdom institution with worldwide reach.  Even the \nQueen of England had an account there. In 1989, Nick Leeson was hired at Barings, where he \nprospered. He was quickly promoted to the trading floor and appointed manager in Singapore where \nhe traded on the Singapore International Monetary Exchange (SIMEX). Leeson was an aggressive \ntrader, making large profits in speculative trading. In 1993, his profits constituted almost 10% of \nBarings' total profits. He had developed a reputation for expertise, for near-infallibility, and his \nsuperiors in London gave him little supervision. \n \nIn July 1992, a new Barings employee suffered a small loss on Leeson's watch. Leeson did not wish to \nlose his reputation for infallibility, or his job, so he hid the loss in an error account. Leeson attempted \nto make back the loss through speculative trading, but this led to even bigger losses, which again were \nhidden in this account. He kept doubling up his bets in an attempt to get out from under the losses. \nLeeson later said: [I] wanted to shout from the rooftops...this is what the situation is, there are \nmassive losses, I want to stop. But for some reason you're unable to do it. ... I had this catastrophic \nsecret which was burning up inside me--yet...I simply couldn't open my mouth and say, 'I've lost \nmillions and millions of pounds.' \n \nLeeson took out a short-term, highly leveraged bet on the Nikkei index in Japan. At the same time, a \nsevere earthquake in Kobe, Japan sent the index plummeting, and his loss was so huge that he could \nno longer hide it.

      "content": "Case Study - Buying Green: Consumer Behavior - Page 1 of 3 \nBuying Green: Consumer Behavior \n \nGreen consumer products, such as organic food, fair trade coffee, or electric cars, represent a fast-\ngrowing segment of the consumer market. In the area of organic food alone, data from the Organic \nTrade Association reveals that consumer demand in the United States has seen double-digit growth \nevery year since 1990. In 2014, the organic food market reached almost $40 billion in sales. Consumers \nof these products tend to be seen in a more positive light--they are deemed more ethical, more \naltruistic, and kinder than people who do not buy green products. But is there another side to this kind \nof consumer behavior? \n \nIn a series of experiments comparing consumption of green and conventional products, psychologists \nNina Mazar and Chen-Bo Zhong demonstrated that those people who bought green products--like \neco-friendly laundry detergent or organic yogurt--were less likely to share money with a stranger, \nmore likely to cheat on a task in which they could earn money, and more likely to steal money when \nthey thought they would not get caught. As the psychologists stated, purchasing green products may \nlicense indulgence in self-interested and unethical behaviors.  \n \nMazar and Zhong, whose study received considerable media attention in their native Canada, as well \nas in American and British publications, said the results surprised them. Initially, they expected green \nproducts to provide a halo effect, whereby the positive impressions associated with green \nconsumption would lead to positive outcomes in other areas. Given that green products are \nmanifestations of high ethical standards and humanitarian considerations, mere exposure [to them \nwould] activate norms of social responsibility and ethical conduct, said Mazar and Zhong in an \ninterview.  \n \nBut as the results indicate, the opposite can be true. The message of this research is that actions \nwhich produce a sense of self content and moral glow can sometimes backfire, Mazar stated in \nanother interview.  \n \nThese patterns have been shown to extend to other shopping scenarios. For example, one study \ntracked scanner data and shopper receipts at a California grocery store. Those shoppers who brought \nreusable grocery bags with them were more likely to buy environmentally friendly products, like \norganic food. But they were also more likely to buy indulgent products, like ice cream, cookies, candy, \nand cake. The researchers followed up this study with a series of experiments that showed these moral \nlicensing effects only happened when the decision to bring the \nreusable bags was at the shopper's discretion. When shoppers \nwere told that the store required customers to use cloth bags, \nlicensing effects disappeared and customers chose not to buy \nindulgent products. Only when consumers felt like using cloth \nbags was their own idea did the moral licensing effects hold.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \nCase Study - Buying Green: Consumer Behavior - Page 2 of 3 \nResources:\n \nOrganic Market Analysis - Organic Trade Association \nhttps://www.ota.com/resources/market-analysis \n \nResearch: Reusable Shopping Bags May Encourage an Unhealthier Diet \nhttp://www.fuqua.duke.edu/news_events/news-releases/bollinger-shopping-bags/ \n \nHow going green may make you mean \nhttps://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/mar/15/green-consumers-more-likely-steal \n \nGoodies behaving badly \nhttps://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cif-green/2010/mar/16/green-consumers-lie-more-\nethics \n \nAre green consumers more unethical? \nhttp://www.torontosun.com/news/columnists/thane_burnett/2010/03/16/13246791.html \n \nWhen buying in means selling out: Sustainable consumption campaigns and unintended  \nuncivic boomerang effects  \nhttp://www.comm.ucsb.edu/faculty/rrice/Atkinson.pdf \n\n \nCase Study - Buying Green: Consumer Behavior - Page 3 of 3 \n \nAuthor: \nLucy Atkinson, Ph.D. \nStan Richards School of Advertising & Public Relations \nMoody College of Communication \nThe University of Texas at Austin",

      "content": "Case Study - In-FUR-mercials: Advertising & Adoption - Page 1 of 3 \n \nIn-FUR-mercials: Advertising & Adoption \n \nThe Animal Foundation is a nonprofit organization operating Nevada's largest open-admission animal \nshelter, the Lied Animal Shelter and pet adoption center. The Lied Animal Shelter is located in Las \nVegas and is financed by taxpayers, grants, and individual donors. It provides a refuge for thousands of \nlost, unwanted, neglected, and abandoned animals every year.   \n \nIn recent years, the Lied Animal Shelter has been plagued by a variety of problems from overcrowding \ndue to a spike in animal intake as residents in the greater Las Vegas area (Clark County) surrendered or \nlost their pets. Analysts believed that the recession of 2008 was a major contributing factor to pet \nabandonment. April Corbin, writing for Las Vegas Weekly, reported: \n \nThe Las Vegas Valley has a problem with domestic animals: we have more that we \nseem able or willing to handle, and those without homes mostly end up at the Lied \nShelter. On any given day, it may be the busiest animal holding facility in the nation. \n...Some blame the recession, which led to the foreclosures of more than 150,000 homes \nin Clark County between January 2007 and May 2014, triggering the wholesale \nabandonment of animals. \n \nIn 2013, the Lied Animal Shelter took in over 40,000 abandoned or lost animals. From that population, \nmore than 10,000 animals were adopted, nearly 5,000 were reunited with their owners, and over \n2,500 were transferred to other facilities. But 21,000 animals--more than half of the animals brought \nto the shelter--were euthanized. Many in Clark County were discouraged by the seemingly \ninsurmountable problems that the Lied Animal Shelter faced. \n \nLeaders at R&R Partners, a full-service, international advertising agency headquartered in Las Vegas, \nbelieved that their persuasive communication skills could help solve Animal Foundation's problem. \nR&R took on the nonprofit as a pro bono client with goals of promoting pet ownership and driving \ntraffic to the Animal Foundation's pet adoption website, NewPetNow.com. The agency staff conducted \nqualitative research in the form of focus groups with R&R employees who were pet owners. They came \nup with the strategy of framing pet adoption not about love and companionship but about pets' many \nhousehold uses (e.g., alarm system, sleeping mask, vacuum cleaner) with a tongue-in-cheek tone. The \nagency staff created an integrated communication campaign of In-FUR-mercial spoofs that portrayed \npets as multi-purpose products for the home. Below are \nlinks to examples of the Pet Dog and Pet Cat In-FUR-\nmercials, and examples of print ads (Exhibits 1 and 2) \nfollow in the Reference section. \n \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChMYMHvpJ0c \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlD3BZHtcqA \n \n\n \nCase Study - In-FUR-mercials: Advertising & Adoption - Page 2 of 3 \n \nAfter the release of the ads in early 2015, the campaign immediately received critical acclaim from \nindustry analysts. ADWEEK contributor Gabriel Beltrone stated, The writing is sharp and funny, the \nacting perfectly overdone, and the voiceover as cheesy as possible--dead-on parody. The In-FUR-\nmercials also received CynopsisMedia's award for the Best 30-Second Spot. \n \nThe campaign connected with audiences in Las Vegas and generated positive press for the Animal \nFoundation and the Lied Shelter, helping them to achieve their goal of increasing pet adoption. The \npercentage of available pets adopted increased by 9.39 percent during 2015, which meant that more \nthan 1,000 additional animals were adopted. \n \nLeaders at R&R Partners acknowledged that the campaign also resulted in important benefits for the \nagency that extended beyond the success and visibility of the campaign. Morale and comraderie within \nthe agency were increased and the agency's reputation as a responsible corporate citizen was \nreinforced. Sarah Catletti, an account supervisor at R&R Partners, described the benefits to the agency: \n \nWelcoming the Animal Foundation to R&R Vegas' list of clients was a great way to \nboost morale within the agency. The pro bono client was chosen through an employee \nvoting system. Since the Animal Foundation was the organization that received the \nlargest number of votes, the entire agency was invested and excited to hear about the \nwork, even those who weren't directly involved with the account. \n \nReferences:\nThe Animal Foundation's 2013 Annual Report \nhttps://issuu.com/theanimalfoundation/docs/2014_annualreport \n\n \nCase Study - In-FUR-mercials: Advertising & Adoption - Page 3 of 3 \n \nAbout The Animal Foundation \nhttp://animalfoundation.com/about/ \nPets are Exciting Multi-use Tools in these Fantastic Infomercials for an Animal Shelter:  Every House \nNeeds One \nhttp://www.adweek.com/adfreak/pets-are-exciting-multi-use-tools-these-fantastic-infomercials-\nanimal-shelter-163663 \nThe No-Kill Dilemma: Can Las Vegas Save All Its Shelter Animals? \nhttp://lasvegasweekly.com/news/2014/aug/07/no-kill-dilemma-can-las-vegas-save-shelter-\nanimals/#/0 \nAnimal Shelter Infomercial Spoofs Show Incredible Household Uses for Cats and Dogs \nhttps://www.good.is/articles/animal-shelter-infomercials \n \n \nExhibit 1 \nPet Cat Print Ad \n \n \nExhibit 2 \nPet Dog Print Ad \n \n \n \n \n \nAuthors: \nMinette E.

      "content": "Case Study - Cheating: Atlanta's School Scandal - Page 1 of 3 \nCheating: Atlanta's School Scandal \n \nIn 2006, Damany Lewis was a 29-year-old math teacher at Parks Middle School in Atlanta. The school \nwas in a run-down neighborhood three miles south of downtown that was plagued by armed \nrobberies. Lewis himself had grown up in a violent neighborhood. He empathized with his students and \nwas devoted to their success. A colleague described Lewis as a star teacher and a very hard worker, \nwho will go the extra mile. \n \nLewis was a teacher when Beverly Hall was Atlanta's school superintendent. Hall believed that business \napproaches and the values of the market system could save public education. She set accountability \nmeasures for the Atlanta school district and created performance objectives that were tougher than \nthose of No Child Left Behind, the federal program that became law in 2002. Teacher evaluations were \nlinked to students' performance on standardized tests. Schools whose students did not make \nappropriate progress toward the standardized test goals received escalating sanctions that culminated \nin replacement of the faculty and staff, and restructuring or closing of the school. \n \nParks Middle School was in dire straights because it had been classified as a school in need of \nimprovement for the previous five years. Unless 58 percent of students passed the math portion of \nthe standardized test and 67 percent passed the language arts portion, Parks Middle School could be \nclosed down. Its students would be separated and bussed across town to different schools. \n \n[It] was my sole obligation to never let that happen, Lewis later told Rachel Aviv in an article about \nthese events in The New Yorker. Lewis had pushed his students to work harder than they ever had in \npreparing for the test. But he knew that it would be very difficult for many of them to pass. Christopher \nWaller, the new principal of Parks, had heard that teachers in the elementary schools that fed into \nParks had changed their students' answers on the standardized tests under the guise of erasing stray \npencil marks.  Waller asked Lewis and other teachers to do the same. Lewis found the exams of \nstudents who needed to get a few more questions right in order to pass. He changed their answers. If \nhe did not change their scores, Lewis feared that his students would lapse into why try attitudes. \nThey would lose their neighborhood school and the community that had developed within it. \n \nThanks to Lewis and other teachers, Parks students did better than ever on the standardized tests. \nNeekisia Jackson, a former student at Parks at the time, recalled, Everyone was jumping up and \ndown, after a teacher announced the school had met the goals of No Child Left Behind for the first \ntime. Jackson continued, We had heard what everyone was \nsaying: 'Y'all aren't good enough.' Now we could finally go to \nschool with our heads held high. \n \nThe same process of changing answers continued at Parks \nthrough 2010. By that time, nine other teachers were helping \nLewis change answers. \n \n\n \nCase Study - Cheating: Atlanta's School Scandal - Page 2 of 3 \nIn October of 2010, 50 agents of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation visited Parks and other Atlanta \nschools. The investigators concluded that teachers and administrators at 44 schools had cheated in the \nmanner that Lewis had. In July of 2012, 110 teachers who had confessed or been accused of cheating \nwere placed on administrative leave, including Lewis. Later that year, Lewis' employment was \nterminated. \n \nThis case study is based on an article by Rachel Aviv entitled, Wrong answer: In an era of high-stakes \ntesting, a struggling school made a shocking choice, that appeared in The New Yorker on July 21, \n2014. \n \n \nResources:\n \nWrong answer: In an era of high stakes testing, a struggling school made a shocking choice \nhttp://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/07/21/wrong-answer \n \nAtlanta School Workers Sentenced in Test Score Cheating Scandal \nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/15/us/atlanta-school-workers-sentenced-in-test-score-cheating-\ncase.html \n \nAs sentencing nears for Atlanta teachers, many condemn their conviction \n\n \nCase Study - Cheating: Atlanta's School Scandal - Page 3 of 3 \nhttp://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-atlanta-teachers-20150407-story.html \n \nA teachable moment from Atlanta's school cheating scandal \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-teachable-moment-from-atlantas-school-cheating-\nscandal/2011/08/04/gIQAMcuE1I_story.html \n \nThe Roots of Atlanta's Cheating Scandal \nhttp://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/04/atlanta-cheating-scandal-117158 \n \nAmerica is criminalizing Black teachers: Atlanta's cheating scandal and the racist underbelly of \neducation reform \nhttp://www.salon.com/2015/04/08/america_is_criminalizing_black_teachers_atlantas_cheating_scan\ndal_and_the_racist_underbelly_of_education_reform/ \n \nAccountability on Trial \nhttp://www.usnews.com/opinion/knowledge-bank/2015/04/03/atlanta-school-cheating-convictions-\nunhelpful-for-education-reform \n \nWhy the Atlanta cheating scandal failed to bring about national reform \nhttp://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/01/atlanta-cheating-scandal-education-reform \n \n \nAuthor: \nMinette E.

      "content": "Case Study - Stangl & the Holocaust - Page 1 of 2 \nStangl & the Holocaust \n \nFranz Stangl was born in Austria in 1908. From a working class family, Stangl trained as a master \nweaver. Unsatisfied in his career, at the age of 23, he applied to become a police officer. In 1936, \ndespite his position in law enforcement, he joined the ranks of the then-illegal Nazi Party. When \nGermany invaded Austria, and subsequently annexed it in March 1938, he became a Gestapo agent. In \n1940, under the order of Nazi leaders, Stangl was appointed as head of security at Hartheim Castle. At \nthe time, Hartheim was one of the secret killing centers used by the authorities to administer mercy \ndeaths to sick and disabled persons. A special unit within the German administration, codenamed T4, \ncarried out this so-called euthanasia program. T4 employed doctors, nurses, lawyers, and police \nofficers, among others, at killing centers in Germany and Austria. In all, historians estimate that the \nstaff at Hartheim killed 18,269 people by August 1941. \n \nAfter a brief stint in Berlin, Stangl transferred to German-occupied Poland in the spring of 1942. Nazi \nauthorities appointed Stangl to be the first commandant of the killing center at Sobir. By September \n1942, having distinguished himself as an effective organizer, Stangl was transferred to what would \nbecome the most horrible of these death camps, Treblinka. While there, he managed and perfected a \nsystem of mass murder, using psychological techniques to first deceive then terrify and subdue his \nvictims before they entered the gas chambers. In less than 18 months, under Stangl's supervision, \nbetween 870,000 and 925,000 Jews were killed at Treblinka. \n \nAfter the war, Franz Stangl and his family emigrated to Brazil where he lived and worked under his own \nname for decades. He was extradited to West Germany in 1967 and tried for his role in the murder of \n900,000 men, women, and children during the Holocaust. During his trial, Stangl claimed that he was \ndoing his duty and was not a murderer. Stangl defended himself by making three main claims. First, \nthat he did not get to choose his postings, and that disobeying an order would put himself and his \nfamily at risk. Second, that once in a position, it was his nature to do an excellent job (he became \nknown as the best commandant in Poland). And third, that he never personally murdered anyone. He \nsaw himself as an administrator. Stangl claimed that his dedication to his work was not about ideology \nor hatred of Jews. \n \nOn October 22, 1970, the court found Stangl guilty of crimes \nagainst humanity and sentenced him to the maximum \npenalty, life in prison. During an interview while in prison, \nhe stated, My conscience is clear about what I did, myself. \n...I have never intentionally hurt anyone, myself. ...But I was \nthere. ...So yes, in reality I share the guilt. He continued, \n\n \nCase Study - Stangl & the Holocaust - Page 2 of 2 \nMy guilt...is that I am still here. That is my guilt.

In the words of Roosevelt, it is the president's duty \nto do anything that the needs of the nation demanded unless such action was forbidden by the \nConstitution or by the laws. Under Roosevelt's expansionist view, anything the president does is \nconsidered acceptable unless it is expressly forbidden by the Constitution or laws passed by Congress. \nRoosevelt believed he served the people, not just the government. He took many actions as president \nthat stretched the limits of the executive branch, including the creation of national parks without \nregard for states' jurisdiction and fostering revolt in Colombia to establish the Panama Canal. \n \nOn the other hand, William Howard Taft, President of the United States from 1909-1913, embodied \nwhat many scholars refer to as a 'strict constructionist' model of the presidency. Under this approach, \nunless the Constitution or Congress explicitly grants a certain power, the president does not have the \nright to act. In Taft's words, the President can exercise no power which cannot be fairly and \nreasonably traced to some specific grant of power or justly implied and included within such express \ngrant as proper and necessary to its exercise. \n \nWhile Roosevelt expanded federal power in many areas, Taft felt many of these actions were legal \noverreaches. For example, as a trust-buster Roosevelt differentiated between 'good' trusts and 'bad' \ntrusts, using his expanded powers as president to make this distinction unilaterally. He made a \n'gentlemen's agreement' with U.S. Steel and told them that the American government would not \nattack their corporation as a monopoly since he believed the company was working in the interests of \nthe American people. Roosevelt did not, however, pass any legislation or make any binding orders to \nthis effect. Taft took a more legalistic view and later, as president, directed his attorney general to file \nan anti-trust lawsuit against U.S. Steel. Roosevelt took Taft's actions as a personal attack upon \nRoosevelt's presidency and positions. \n \nAlthough Taft continued many of Roosevelt's policies, he was inclined to look at the facts of the \nsituation and make a choice based on evidence. Roosevelt, on the other hand, was more inclined to do \nwhat he felt was right.

      "content": "Case Study - Freedom vs. Duty in Clinical Social Work - Page 1 of 3 \nFreedom vs. Duty in Clinical Social Work \nMental health clinicians are taught to introspect about the degree to which their own background, \nculture, values, and beliefs may affect their reactions to their clients, and to strive to maintain \nobjectivity in the process of assessment, diagnosis, and treatment. Clinical social workers are the \nlargest professional group providing mental health services in the United States, providing services in \nurban and rural outpatient and inpatient settings. Social workers are seen as different from clinical \npsychologists, psychiatrists, and other occupational groups that provide therapy in the emphasis that \nsocial work places on social justice, cultural competence, and respect for diversity. According to the \nNational Association of Social Workers Code of Ethics, the social work profession requires its members \nto act to prevent and eliminate...discrimination against any person, group, or class on the basis of \nrace, ethnicity, national origin, color, sex, sexual orientation, age, marital status, political belief, \nreligion, or mental or physical disability.  \nAn ethical dilemma may arise when the religious or moral beliefs of the social worker interfere with \nthe duty of all health care professionals to provide optimal service to clients and to do no harm. This \nissue made national headlines in a related context, when Kim Davis, a clerk in Rowan County, Kentucky, \nwas jailed after defying a federal court order to issue marriage licenses to gay couples. Her action was \nbased on her contention that to do so would violate her religious beliefs. In his ruling, Judge David L. \nBunning of the United States District Court stated, If you give people the opportunity to choose which \norders they follow, that's what potentially causes problems. In defense of Davis, Ryan Anderson of the \nHeritage Foundation wrote, Ms. Davis felt she had to follow her conscience... That, after all, is what \nreligious freedom and religious accommodations are all about: creating the space for citizens to fulfill \ntheir duties, as they understand them, to God--regardless of what the rest of us think.  \nA similar conflict between religious faith and the requirements of one's job or one's profession may be \nseen in social work practice in the following scenario: \nA clinical social worker has been treating a 25-year-old man for depression and anxiety. In the fourth \nsession, the client reveals that he is gay, and that he has not come out to his family. He states that he \nhas been involved in a committed, monogamous relationship with another man, and is contemplating \nmarriage. He would like to inform his parents of this good news, but is fearful that they may angrily \nreject him. He is seeking counseling around this issue. The social worker belongs to a faith tradition \nthat believes that homosexuality is a sin, and whose leaders have been prominent in opposing same-\nsex marriage. The social worker, who had up to this point \nbelieved that treatment was going well, is concerned that his \nown religiously based objections to homosexuality will interfere \nwith his ability to provide unbiased mental health treatment \nservices. The social worker contemplates informing the client \nthat he will have to transfer him to another therapist. \n \n\n \nCase Study - Freedom vs. Duty in Clinical Social Work - Page 2 of 3 \nResources:\nCode of Ethics of the National Association of Social Workers \nhttp://socialworkers.org/pubs/code/default.asp \n \nIssues and ethics in the helping professions \nhttp://www.worldcat.org/title/issues-and-ethics-in-the-helping-professions/oclc/36621768 \n \nClerk in Kentucky chooses jail over deal on same-sex marriage \nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/04/us/kim-davis-same-sex-marriage.html \n \nWe don't need Kim Davis to be in jail \nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/07/opinion/we-dont-need-kim-davis-to-be-in-jail.html \n\n \nCase Study - Freedom vs. Duty in Clinical Social Work - Page 3 of 3 \n \nMormons say duty to law on same-sex marriage trumps faith \nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/23/us/mormons-still-against-same-sex-unions-take-a-stand-\nagainst-kim-davis.html \n \nAuthor: \nMitch Sudolsky, MSSW, LCSW \nSchool of Social Work \nThe University of Texas at Austin",

Klessig \n \nIn 2003, a research team from prominent laboratory the Boyce Thompson Institute (BTI) for Plant \nResearch in Ithaca, New York published an article in the prestigious academic journal Cell. It was \nconsidered a breakthrough paper in that it answered a major question in the field of plant cell biology. \nThe first author of this paper was postdoctoral researcher Meena Chandok, working under her \nsupervisor Daniel Klessig, president of BTI at the time.  \n \nAfter Chandok left BTI for another job, other researchers in the laboratory were unable to repeat the \nresults published in Cell, following exactly the same methods described in the article.  Klessig, \nsuspecting possible scientific misconduct, requested Chandok to return to the laboratory to redo her \nexperiments and confirm the authenticity of her results, but she declined. An institutional investigation \ninto the experiment concluded there was no conclusive evidence that Dr. Chandok achieved the \nresults reported, but also that there was no conclusive evidence of misconduct or that Chandok had \nfabricated the results. Klessig and the other co-authors retracted the article without Chandok's \nagreement. Chandok subsequently sued Klessig for defamation, claiming the retraction had caused \nsignificant damage to her career and reputation within the scientific community.  \n \nOver several years in court, the case drew attention to a number of issues in scientific research and \npublishing. John Travis, an editor at Science magazine, wrote of the case's consistency with the \nNational Institutes of Health's grant policy that researchers should come forward with concerns about \npossible misconduct. John Dahlberg, director of the Office of Research Integrity's Division of \nInvestigative Oversight, believed the case could encourage anyone with fear of being sued for \ndefamation to come forward. Science writer Eugenie Reich described Klessig as a whistle-blower, \nwhile philosopher Janet Stemwedel raised questions surrounding the collaborative responsibility of the \ncoauthors and Klessig with regard to quality control for the research. She asked, If credit is shared, \nwhy isn't blame? \n \nIn 2011, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York dismissed the case. It ruled that \nKlessig's statements were legally protected because they were matters as to which the speaker [had] \na legal or moral obligation to notify the journal that his \nlaboratory could not replicate the results they had published \nand were made between communicants who [shared] a \ncommon interest.

In 2005, the book was selected for Oprah's Book Club, in part for the inspiring and supposedly true story of Frey's overcoming addiction. The publicity from The Oprah Winfrey Show sparked strong sales for the book, which topped bestseller lists in the following weeks.\nOn January 8, 2006, investigative website The Smoking Gun published an expose describing numerous exaggerations and fabrications in Frey's account of his life story as written, creating controversy regarding the truthfulness of the book as a memoir. When Frey first appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 2005, he emphasized his honesty: If I was going to write a book that was true, and I was going to write a book that was honest, then I was going to have to write about myself in very negative ways. As he did so, he expanded on falsehoods that appeared in the book.\n\nFrey and his publisher, Nan Talese, were unable to effectively refute The Smoking Gun allegations. When Winfrey invited Frey back on her show, she harangued him for lying, saying that she felt duped and that Frey had betrayed millions of readers. Talese described Winfrey's rebuke of Frey as mean and self-serving, while critics of Frey saw him as opportunistic.\nFrey defended the right of authors and memoirists to draw upon their memories, not only upon documented facts: I wanted the stories in the book to ebb and flow, to have dramatic arcs, to have the tension that all great stories require. Authors and literary critics have echoed this sentiment, noting that memoirs are not necessarily the same genre as biographies or autobiographies.

      "title": "Climate-Change-the-Paris-Deal",
      "content": "Climate Change & the Paris Deal\nIn December 2015, representatives from 195 nations gathered in Paris and signed an international agreement to address climate change, which many observers called a breakthrough for several reasons. First, the fact that a deal was struck at all was a major accomplishment, given the failure of previous climate change talks. Second, unlike previous climate change accords that focused exclusively on developed countries, this pact committed both developed and developing countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, the voluntary targets established by nations in the Paris climate deal fall considerably short of what many scientists deem necessary to achieve the stated goal of the negotiations: limiting the global temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius. Furthermore, since the established targets are voluntary, they may be lowered or abandoned due to political resistance, short- term economic crises, or simply social fatigue or disinterest.\n\nAs philosophy professor Stephen Gardiner aptly explains, the challenge of climate change presents the world with several fundamental ethical dilemmas. It is simultaneously a profoundly global, intergenerational, and philosophical problem. First, from a global perspective, climate change presents the world with a collective action problem: all countries have a collective interest in controlling global carbon emissions. But each individual country also has incentives to over-consume (in this case, to emit as much carbon as necessary) in response to societal demands for economic growth and prosperity.\nSecond, as an intergenerational problem, the consequences of actions taken by the current generation will have the greatest impact on future generations yet to be born. Thus, the current generation must forego benefits today in order to protect against possibly catastrophic costs in the future. This tradeoff is particularly difficult for developing countries. They must somehow achieve economic growth in the present to break out of a persistent cycle of poverty, while limiting the amount of greenhouse gasses emitted into the atmosphere to protect future generations. The fact that prosperous, developed countries (such as the U.S. and those in Europe) arguably created the current climate problems during their previous industrial economic development in the 19th and 20th centuries complicates the tradeoffs between economic development and preventing further climate change.\nFinally, the global and intergenerational nature of climate change points to the underlying philosophical dimensions of the problem. While it is intuitive that the current generation has some ethical responsibility to leave an inhabitable world to\nfuture generations, the extent of this obligation is less clear. The same goes for individual countries who have pledged to reduce carbon emissions to help protect environmental health, but then face real economic and social costs when executing those pledges. Developing nations faced with these costs may encounter further challenges as the impact of climate change will most likely fall disproportionally on the poor, thus also raising issues of fairness and inequality.",

      "content": "Ebola & American Intervention\nIn 2014, a highly contagious and deadly virus, Ebola, emerged in Western Africa, primarily in the countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea. The epidemic caught world health authorities off guard, ultimately killing thousands and threatening to develop into a worldwide epidemic. A broad range of organizations and politicians, from health care authorities and Doctors Without Borders to the World Health Organization and Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, made dramatic appeals for American military intervention. The legacy of colonial ties affected the perceptions of responsibility for provision of assistance. The United Kingdom took charge of relief efforts in Sierra Leone, France in Guinea, and the United States in Liberia, a state founded in the 19th century by former African-American slaves.\n\nAfter initially receiving criticism for acting too cautiously, President Obama responded by sending over 3,000 military personnel, mostly medics and engineers, to Liberia. It was the largest American intervention ever in a global health crisis. President Obama justified this decision by arguing that the United States had an ethical obligation as a leader of the global community to address the humanitarian crisis in Liberia as well as a security interest in controlling the epidemic in Africa so that it did not spread to the U.S. and other countries. According to President Obama, only the American military had the resources, hierarchical structure, and discipline to carry out such a largescale effort.\nObjections to the militarization of this relief effort came in several forms. Conservative critics argued that militaries are for fighting and winning wars, not providing humanitarian assistance. Others argued the humanitarian effort could morph into security and military engagement. David Ridenhour, president of the National Center for Public Policy Research, worried that American soldiers could be faced with difficult moral dilemmas, such as having to shoot unarmed, possibly infected Liberian civilians or allow Ebola to spread. Some critics were concerned that U.S. military intervention jeopardized the principle of neutrality that health relief organizations try to maintain. Historian Andrew Bacevich argued that a military response to a humanitarian crisis, even if successful, would mask and perpetuate gross misallocation of resources toward building military capacity rather than address global health care needs.\nUltimately, the Ebola epidemic was brought under control in Liberia and the rest of Western Africa. The United States military built 11 treatment units and the government expended hundreds of millions of dollars in the relief effort. However, as The New York\nTimes reported, there is limited evidence that these efforts played any significant role. Only 28 Ebola patients were treated in the 11 treatment centers built by the military. The number of new Ebola cases peaked at 635 the week after President Obama announced the military intervention, but dropped to just over 100 by the time the first medical unit was opened. By the time the additional units were operational, Ebola cases had dwindled to less than 50.",

Many animal rights activists often protest bullfighting in Spain and other countries, citing the needless endangerment of the bull and bullfighter. Some cities around the world where bullfighting was once popular, including Coslada (Spain), Mouans-Sartoux (France), and Teocelo (Mexico), have even declared themselves to be anti-bullfighting cities. Other places, including some towns in Catalonia (Spain), have ceased killing the bull in the fight, but continue bullfighting.\n\nTo other people, the spectacle of the bullfight is not mere sport. The event is not only culturally significant, but also a fine art in which the bullfighter is trained in a certain style and elicits emotion through the act of the fight. Writer Alexander Fiske-Harrison, in his research and training as a bullfighter, defends the practice and circumstances\nof the bull, In terms of animal welfare, the fighting bull lives four to six years whereas the meat cow lives one to two. ...Those years are spent free roaming...

Similar to the 2004 bill that outlawed the use of conspicuous religious symbols in public schools, including Muslim headscarves and Christian crosses, this law sought to further remove religious expression and iconography from public spaces in France. Some legislators argued that the burka was a harmful symbol of gender inequality that forced women to assume a subservient status to men in public. According to them, the law freed women from a discriminatory, patriarchal subculture.\n\nHowever, some in the French Muslim community saw the bill as an infringement of religious freedom and an act of cultural imperialism. They argued that French legislators were imposing their idea of gender equality onto their culture. Many of them, including some women, argued that wearing burkas actually emancipated women from the physical objectification so common in Western culture. A number of women protested the bill by dressing in burkas and going to the offices of lawmakers who supported the legislation. Other reports from individual women suggested that the law created a more hostile atmosphere for Islamic women in France. One of these women critiqued the bill, stating, My quality of\nlife has seriously deteriorated since the ban...the politicians claimed they were liberating us; what they've done is to exclude us from the social sphere.\nThe law was challenged in 2014 and taken to the European Court of Human Rights. The court upheld the legality of the law.",

      "content": "Appropriating Hope\nArtists commonly appropriate, or borrow, objects or images and include them in their artwork. Andy Warhol, for example, is well known for appropriating images of Campbell's soup cans for his pop art. Typically, the original object or image remains recognizable, but the new work of art transforms or recontextualizes the borrowed image or object in order to generate new meaning. Many artists believe that without artistic appropriation, creating new art would not be possible. On the other hand, the line between copyright infringement and fair use is not always clear.\nIn 2008, Shepard Fairey appropriated an Associated Press (A.P.) photo of Barack Obama to create his well-known Hope image of the presidential candidate. In 2009, Fairey filed a preemptive lawsuit against The A.P., requesting that the court declare protection from any copyright infringement claims on the basis of fair use. Fair use is the copying of copyrighted material for limited transformative purposes, such as criticism, parody, or commentary. Fairey acknowledged that his image was based on a 2006 photograph taken by A.P. photographer Mannie Garcia. The\nA.P. claimed that any use of the photo required permission and asked for credit and compensation.\n\nAnthony T. Falzone, executive director of the Fair Use Project and one of Fairey's lawyers, said that Fairey only used the original image as a reference and transformed it into a stunning, abstracted and idealized visual image that created powerful new meaning and conveys a radically different message. Paul Colford, spokesman for The A.P., said, [The A.P. was] disappointed by the surprise filing by Shepard Fairey and his company and by Mr. Fairey's failure to recognize the rights of photographers in their works. Mannie Garcia argued that he actually owned the copyright to the photo, not The A.P., according to his contract at the time. He stated, I don't condone people taking things, just because they can... But in this case I think it's a very unique situation... If you put all the legal stuff away, I'm so proud of the photograph and that Fairey did what he did artistically with it, and the effect it's had.\nAfter two years in court, Shepard Fairey and The A.P. settled the case with an undisclosed financial agreement. Fairey also gave up fair use rights to any other A.P. photos, and both sides agreed to share the rights to make posters and merchandise based on the Hope image.",

      "content": "Blurred Lines of Copyright\n\nIn 2013, Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams co-produced the run-away hit single Blurred Lines, earning them over $16 million in sales and streaming revenues. The music video has been viewed hundreds of millions of times on YouTube and Vevo, and has been parodied numerous times as well. Despite its popularity, the similarity of Blurred Lines to Marvin Gaye's 1977 hit song Got to Give It Up sparked controversy. The family of artist Marvin Gaye was outraged; they believed Gaye's work was stolen. Thicke filed a preemptive lawsuit to prevent the Gaye family from claiming any share of royalties. However, Thicke also stated in public interviews that he was influenced by Marvin Gaye and, specifically, Got to Give It Up when he co-composed Blurred Lines with Williams.\nIn response, the Gaye family sued Williams and Thicke. Contradictions were apparent in Thicke's account. In an interview with GQ, he stated that he co-wrote Blurred Lines. But in court he claimed that he was too high in the studio, and that Williams had in fact composed the song, and he had lied earlier in order to get credit. Williams claimed that, although Gaye's music had influenced him in his youth, he did not copy Gaye's song in his composition.\n\nIn March 2015, the jury ruled in favor of the Gaye estate, stating that while Williams and Thicke did not directly copy Got to Give It Up, there was enough of a similar feel to warrant copyright infringement. Gaye's heirs were awarded $7.4 million in damages, the largest amount ever granted in a music copyright case.\nWhile many commentators agreed with this verdict, others were concerned that it could negatively affect song writing within an entire genre. Musicologist Robert Fink, for example, stated that this verdict had the potential to set a precedent for\nfencing off our shared heritage of sounds, grooves, vibes, tunes, and feels. Musicians, artists, and writers often note that previous works influence them in their creative process, and that there is very little that is completely original. Thicke and Williams did not see the musical influence of Gaye as copyright infringement, but rather as inspiration that spurred them to create a new, original single.",

According to many legal experts, and the U.S. government, his actions violated the Espionage Act of 1917, which identified the leak of state secrets as an act of treason. Yet despite the fact that he broke the law, Snowden argued that he had a moral obligation to act. He gave a justification for his whistleblowing by stating that he had a duty to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them. According to Snowden, the government's violation of privacy had to be exposed regardless of legality.\n\nMany agreed with Snowden. Jesselyn Radack of the Government Accountability Project defended his actions as ethical, arguing that he acted from a sense of public good. Radack said, Snowden may have violated a secrecy agreement, which is not a loyalty oath but a contract, and a less important one than the social contract a democracy has with its citizenry. Others argued that even if he was legally culpable, he was not ethically culpable because the law itself was unjust and unconstitutional.\nThe Attorney General of the United States, Eric Holder, did not find Snowden's rationale convincing. Holder stated, He broke the law. He caused harm to our national security and I think that he has to be held accountable for his actions.\nJournalists were conflicted about the ethical implications of Snowden's actions. The editorial board of The New York Times stated, He may have committed a crime...but he has done his country a great service.

      "content": "Patient Autonomy & Informed Consent\nIn the context of health care in the United States, the value on autonomy and liberty was cogently expressed by Justice Benjamin Cardozo in Schloendorff v. Society of New York Hospitals (1914), when he wrote, Every human being of adult years and sound mind has a right to determine what shall be done with his own body. This case established the principle of informed consent and has become central to modern medical practice ethics. However, a number of events since 1914 have illustrated how the autonomy of patients may be overridden. In Buck v. Bell (1927), Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote that the involuntary sterilization of mental defectives, then a widespread practice in the U.S., was justified, stating, Three generations of imbeciles are enough. Another example, the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, in which African-American males were denied life-saving treatment for syphilis as part of a scientific study of the natural course of the disease, began in 1932 and was not stopped until 1972.\nProviding advice related to topics of bioethics, the President's Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research stated, Informed consent is rooted in the fundamental recognition--reflected in the legal presumption of competency--that adults are entitled to accept or reject health care interventions on the basis of their own personal values and in furtherance of their own personal goals. But what of circumstances where patients are deemed incompetent through judicial proceedings, and where someone else is designated to make decisions on behalf of a mentally incompetent individual?\nConsider the following case:\nA middle aged man was involuntarily committed to a state psychiatric hospital because he was considered dangerous to others due to severe paranoid thinking. His violent behavior was controlled only by injectable medications, which were initially administered against his will. He had been declared mentally incompetent, and the decisions to approve the use of psychotropic medications were made by his adult son who had been awarded guardianship and who held medical power of attorney.\nWhile the medications suppressed the patient's violent agitation, they made little impact on his paranoid symptoms. His chances of being able to return to his home community appeared remote. However, a new drug was introduced into the hospital formulary which, if used with this patient, offered the strong possibility that he could return home. The drug, however, was only available in a pill form, and the patient's paranoia included fears that others would try to poison him. The suggestion was made to grind up the pill and surreptitiously administer the drug by mixing it in pudding.\nHospital staff checked with the patient's son and obtained informed consent from him. The personal values and...personal goals of the son and other family members were seen to substitute for those of the mentally incompetent patient--and these goals included the desire for the patient to live outside of an institution and close to loved ones in the community. This was the explicitly stated\n \nrationale for the son's agreeing to the proposal to hide the medication in food. However, staff were uncomfortable about deceiving the patient, despite having obtained informed consent from the patient's guardian.",

      "content": "Welfare Reform\nIn 1996, Democratic President Bill Clinton and a Republican-led Congress passed The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA), also known as the Welfare Reform Act. This bill changed how government-funded welfare operated in the United States. PRWORA reduced the amount of federal spending for low-income families, placed a limit on the number of years a person could receive federal financial assistance, and required recipients to work within two years of receiving benefits. It also included legislation that limited the funding available to unmarried parents under the age of 18, enhanced legal enforcement of child support, and restricted funding for immigrants. Republican supporters believed these provisions would curb the number of out-of-wedlock births.\n\nThe bill ignited a decades-long debate about individual responsibility versus social responsibility and the role of the government in directly alleviating poverty. On the one hand, the bill was heralded as an important step toward helping welfare recipients achieve self-reliance and employment. Through this bill, Clinton aimed to end welfare as we know it by creating job opportunities that would help stop a cycle of poverty and dependency. Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and his colleagues in Congress pressured Clinton to make the bill even more austere. They argued that reducing welfare funding reinforced core American values of individual responsibility, hard work, independence, and free enterprise.\nCritics of the bill argued that it negatively affected the most vulnerable people in society. Several members of Clinton's administration even resigned as a result of the bill. One of these detractors, Peter Edelman, argued that welfare reform would not solve the problem, but rather drive millions more people into poverty, many of them single mothers and their children. During the debate, Senator Edward Kennedy called the bill legislative child abuse. From this perspective, the government was essentially abdicating its responsibility to care for children and impoverished people who are systemically disadvantaged.\nThe bill was effective for getting people off of welfare at first, in part due to a booming economy in the late 1990s. By 2000, welfare caseloads were at their lowest level in 30 years. However, wages tended to be barely above the poverty line and did not provide long term financial stability. Financial instability was exacerbated by the economic downturn in 2008. In a 2016 report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities examining the effects of PRWORA and related policies, research showed several findings: Employment increases...were modest and\nfaded over time; Stable employment...[was] the exception, not the norm; Most recipients...never found work even after participation in work programs...; The large majority of individuals...remained poor, and some became poorer; and Voluntary employment programs can significantly increase employment without the negative impacts of ending basic assistance...\n \nThe government's role in supporting the poor through direct aid remains an active debate in the U.S. today.",

The number of minors apprehended as they tried to enter the U.S. nearly doubled over the previous year from 35,200 to 66,120. The fastest growing segment of child migrants were those under 12 years old, increasing concern that vulnerable children were risking their lives on a dangerous journey to the U.S. to escape violence and poverty in their home countries. The influx posed a number of logistical and ethical dilemmas for state and federal authorities, and overwhelmed the capacity of authorities to process new migrants or even provide shelter for them.\n\nThe Obama administration responded with a multifaceted plan that included millions of dollars of emergency funding. The plan called for increased border enforcement, deportation of those deemed economic migrants, more detention facilities, additional immigration judges to process claims for political asylum as refugees, and new programs in countries of origin that would mitigate violence and economic hardship for minors as well as discourage or intercept migrants before reaching the U.S. Because facilities at the border were being overrun, the government also transported some migrants to other parts of the country. This drew protests from local communities that tried to turn back buses filled with migrant children. The administration's response drew criticism from all quarters.\nHuman rights and refugee advocates, as well as many religious institutions, argued that the U.S. was neglecting its moral obligation to protect innocent and vulnerable children, many of whom were fleeing violence at the hands of criminal gangs and the drug trade. According to journalist Sonia Nazario, the influx of minors was not a crisis of illegal immigration but rather a refugee crisis: the violence in countries, such as Honduras, was prompting youths to flee their homes as a means of survival. Nazario argued that these refugees, similar to refugees in war-torn regions such as Syria, deserved legal and physical protection. She criticized the Obama administration for concentrating on border enforcement and interdiction of child migrants instead.\nOthers argued the opposite point: that the crisis was brought on by weak control of U.S. borders.\nAccording to Jessica Vaughn, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, the ongoing crisis was the best evidence yet that lax enforcement, both at the border and within the country, and talk of amnesty only bring more illegal immigration. She and others promoting stronger limits on immigration urged the Obama administration to turn back those who entered the country illegally on the grounds that the only way to end this crisis was to stem the tide of migrants before they got to the U.S.",

      "content": "Snyder v. Phelps\nMatthew Snyder was a Marine Lance Corporal from Maryland who died in Iraq on March 2, 2006 at the\nage of 20. The Westboro Baptist Church, led by Fred Phelps, announced in advance that they would\npicket his funeral. Westboro contends that American military deaths are a direct result of God's\nvengeance for the tolerance of homosexuality in the United States. Church members protest military\nfunerals because they believe enlisted soldiers voluntarily [join] a fag-infested army to fight for a fag-\nrun country. They denounced Snyder's parents, Albert Snyder and Julia Francis, for raising their son\nCatholic. They claimed Snyder and Francis taught their son to be an idolater and support the world's\nlargest pedophile machine. At Snyder's funeral, Westboro members held up signs saying Fag\nTroops, God hates the U.S.A., and many others of a similar nature.\nAlbert Snyder sued for defamation stemming from false statements made about his son's upbringing.\nHe also sued for publicity given to private life because his son's funeral was a private, not public\nevent. These counts were dismissed because the defamation fell under religious opinion and because\nan obituary was printed with details of their religion. Other counts, including intrusion upon seclusion,\nintentional infliction of emotional distress, and civil conspiracy, were all allowed to continue.\nWestboro Baptist Church maintained that they followed all local ordinances and were compliant with\nall police instructions. They were allowed to picket in an area designated by police about 1000 feet\nfrom the church. Albert Snyder claimed he saw the tops of signs, but only read their contents when he\nsaw a news program on television afterwards. Evidence was presented that showed Albert Snyder\nsuffered physical and emotional harm, including complications from diabetes and depression.\nAt the district court level, Albert Snyder was awarded a total of $5 million in damages, but the Fourth\nCircuit later reversed this ruling. It was then appealed to the Supreme Court, which upheld the ruling of\nthe Fourth Circuit: Westboro Baptist Church was within\ntheir free speech rights set forth in the First Amendment.\nThe primary message of their signs dealt with their broad\npublic message and not one specific individual, even if it\nwas hurtful. The court ruling stated, Because this Nation\nhas chosen to protect even hurtful speech on public issues\nto ensure that public debate is not stifled, Westboro must\nbe shielded from tort liability for its picketing in this case.\nCase Study - Snyder v.

      "content": "Cadavers in Car Safety Research\nIn 1993, it was widely disclosed that research engineers at Heidelberg University in Germany had used 200 adult and child cadavers in simulated car crash tests. The researchers argued that the use of human cadavers was necessary to study the actual effects of these crashes on the body. They insisted that the research would save lives because it would help engineers design safer cars.\nThere was significant public outcry against this practice from numerous groups. The ADAC, Germany's largest automobile club, issued a statement challenging the research on ethical grounds: In an age when experiments on animals are being put into question, such tests must be carried out on dummies and not on children's cadavers. Rudolph Hammerschmidt, spokesman for the Roman Catholic German Bishops' Conference similarly decried the practice, arguing, Even the dead possess human dignity...this research should be done with manikins. Political leaders also weighed in on the debate. Klaus von Trotha, research minister of Baden-Wuerttemberg state, questioned the study: Our constitution guarantees freedom in scientific research. But the constitution also guarantees the protection of human dignity.\n\nThe university defended its research by pointing to the results. Dr. Rainer Mattern, the head of Heidelberg University's forensic pathology department, responded to public reaction against the use of child cadavers, arguing, The tests have saved lives of other children.\nWhen it was revealed that similar tests were being conducted in the United States at Wayne State University, some U.S. officials offered their support. George Parker, the associate administrator for research at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration argued, We need that type of data to find out how people are injured in crashes to know what areas of the body are injured under what conditions. He added that human subjects were necessary to determine the validity of the data gathered from crash test dummies: If you didn't do this\ntesting, you wouldn't know what limits to put on dummies for crash tests.\nFor many, the debate ultimately hinged on whether the research yielded information not attainable from crash dummies and whether or not the families gave their consent to the use of the cadavers.",

Fallin posed for this \nphoto as a promotional piece for her band, Pink Pony. Public outcry criticized Fallin for appropriating \nNative American cultures, sparking uproar on social media and leading to protests at their shows. \n \nIn response, Fallin and Pink Pony removed the photo and released a statement on their Facebook page \nexplaining their aesthetic appreciation for Native American culture. Fallin told the Indian Country \nToday Media Network that, I think Native American culture is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen, \nso I was naturally drawn to it. Musician Wayne Coyne of The Flaming Lips became involved in the \nissue when he fired bandmate Kliph Scurlock for criticizing Fallin online. To show his support for Fallin, \nCoyne posted Instagram photos of several friends and a dog wearing headdresses. \n \nSome argue that Fallin's photo could be an example of artistic appropriation. Throughout history, \nartists have borrowed objects and images from everyday life as well as other cultures in order to re-\ncontextualize the object in a new manner. On the other hand, some argue that non-Native Americans \ndo not have the right to adorn a headdress at all.

Summer Morgan, member of the Kiowa tribe in Oklahoma, \nbelieves that Fallin may have had good intentions, but there are better ways to express her \nappreciation of Native American cultures. Morgan believes \nthat headdresses are not fashion accessories. Following \nKiowa tradition, only men can own war bonnets and each \nfeather represents a war deed.

      "content": "Case Study - High Stakes Testing - Page 1 of 2 \nHigh Stakes Testing \n \n \nSince the enactment of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB), some parents, teachers, \nand administrators have taken their own stand against something that they believe is harmful for \npublic education and American children: high stakes testing.  Under NCLB, every child in the U.S. must \nachieve proficiency in reading and math. While each state can determine its own level of proficiency, a \nchild's ability to advance to the next grade level, and even graduate from high school, hinges on \npassing a standardized test. Across the U.S., children in minority communities have been more likely \nnot to receive a diploma due to low-test scores on mandated exams. \n \n  \nAssessment has many benefits. Advocates of large-scale assessments claim that it is an \nobjective and fair measure of student achievement.  Results show how students, or groups of students, \nmeasure up against one another and broader standards. Ideally, all children throughout the country \nwill receive an equal education, and testing can help educators target where instructional \nimprovements are necessary. Sonja Brookins Santelises, Vice President of K-12 Policy and Practice for \nthe Education Trust, acknowledges that there is too much rote test preparation, but argues that we \nmust work together to reduce the achievement gap among student populations. The founder of \nnonprofit organization StudentsFirst and former Chancellor of D.C. Public Schools, Michelle Rhee, also \nsees standardized testing as a means to reduce this gap. She states, It's not inconceivable for a \nstudent to be receiving all A's and B's on her report card but still be stuck far behind her peers in other \ndistricts and states across the country. And without standardized testing, that child's parents, teachers \nand principal would have no idea. \n \n \nOpponents, however, firmly believe that high stakes testing is problematic and even ruinous to \nour educational system. There is no research to corroborate that standardized testing, a multi-billion \ndollar industry controlled by three large U.S. corporations, is effective. Teachers complain that they are \nforced to teach to the test, leaving little or no time for subjects that are not tested, such as art, social \nstudies, and science. Parent and former teacher Edy Chamness founded a Facebook group in 2011 to \nrally parents in her community to protest against school \naccountability and standardized testing requirements. She \nalso kept her son out of school on testing days. Other parents, \nincluding Maeve Siano of Celina, Texas, similarly felt that the \npreparation and stress associated with testing were more \nlikely to damage her son than help him. Celina Superintendent \nDonny O'Dell stated, Our country was basically founded on \nrebellion, so to speak. So I don't hold that against any of these \nparents, but we as educators have to do what we have to do...and we need some form of \naccountability. \n \n \nResources:\n \nTesting, Assessment, and Excellence \nhttp://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/schools/testing/merrow.html \nIs the Use of Standardized Tests Improving Education in America?  \nhttp://standardizedtests.procon.org/ \nHigh Stakes Testing \nhttp://www.education.com/reference/article/high-stakes-testing1/ \nCrash Test \nhttp://www.texasmonthly.com/story/crash-test/ \nStandardized test backlash: More parents pull kids from exams as protest  \nhttp://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Education/2015/0430/Standardized-test-backlash-More-parents-\npull-kids-from-exams-as-protest \nTesting the Limits: A Texas Mother's Radical Revolt Against Standardized Tests \nhttp://www.texasobserver.org/mother-against-standardized-testing/ \nMichelle Rhee: Opting out of standardized tests?

      "content": "The CIA Leak\nIn 2002, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) asked Joseph Wilson, U.S. diplomat and husband of CIA\nagent Valerie Plame, to investigate allegations that Saddam Hussein purchased yellowcake uranium in\nNiger. Wilson traveled to Niger and found no evidence of this. Nonetheless, during the 2003 State of\nthe Union Address, President George W. Bush stated, The British government has learned that\nSaddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa. On July 6, 2003, Wilson\nrebutted this statement in an editorial for The New York Times. One week later, journalist Robert\nNovak published an op-ed in The Washington Post criticizing Wilson and releasing information\nidentifying Plame as a CIA agent. Another journalist, Matthew Cooper, wrote in Time Magazine that\ngovernment officials informed him that Wilson's wife was employed by the CIA. Plame was a classified\ncovert agent and her actual employment was not public knowledge. Her employer, Brewster Jennings,\nwas thus unmasked as a CIA front company and their employees worldwide were put at risk.\nThe CIA asked the Department of Justice to investigate the leak. Bush stated if a leak occurred from his\nadministration and if the person violated the law, the person will be taken care of. He later said, If\nsomeone committed a crime, they will no longer work in my administration. A special counsel\nexamined the legal violations and a grand jury summoned the journalists involved, as well as various\nmembers of the Bush administration, with a focus on presidential aide Karl Rove and Scooter Libby,\nChief of Staff for Vice President Dick Cheney.\nCooper claimed Rove told him Plame's name and employment, while Rove contended he only learned\nof her name from journalists. Evidence suggested Cheney might have informed Libby. Eventually, the\nsource was revealed as Richard Armitage, Deputy Secretary of State at the time. Armitage was\nultimately not charged because no evidence existed to prove he was aware Plame's employment was\ncovert, and thus, illegal to disclose.\nThe only person charged over the leak was Libby. He was indicted on two counts of perjury, two counts\nof making false statements, and one count of obstruction of justice. These charges all stemmed from\ntestimony he gave during the investigation, not the initial disclosure of information. He resigned from\nhis position, and was later fined and sentenced to\nthirty months in federal prison. President Bush\ncommuted the prison time, but left the fines intact.\nCheney aggressively sought a full pardon for Libby\nand was reportedly very upset with Bush for\nrefusing to grant it. Bush publicly stated he\nrespected the jury's verdict, but Cheney felt Libby\ndid nothing inappropriate.\nCase Study - The CIA Leak - Page 1 of 4\nWilson and Plame eventually filed a civil lawsuit against Rove, Libby, Cheney, and Armitage for their\nrole in disclosing her identity. The lawsuit was dismissed, and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear\nthe dismissal on appeal.\nIn 2018, President Donald Trump pardoned Libby, stating, I don't know Mr. Libby, but for years I have\nheard that he has been treated unfairly. Hopefully, this full pardon will help rectify a very sad portion\nof his life. Cheney responded to the pardon, stating, He is innocent, and he and his family have\nsuffered for years because of his wrongful conviction. I am grateful today that President Trump righted\nthis wrong.\nPlame saw the pardon as a dangerous precedent that could further endanger the safety of covert\noperatives and the operations of the CIA. In an op-ed, Plame wrote, The pardon power of the\npresident cannot be challenged constitutionally; it should be wielded with enormous diligence and\nprudence. In granting his pardon to Scooter Libby, Donald Trump seems to have avoided the careful\nprocess of review within the Justice Department that has been established to consider pardons,\ncontinuing, Our national security is at serious risk when there is daylight and distrust between the\npresident and the CIA.",

A report published by an influenza expert at the British Columbia Centre for Disease \nControl found that the 2014-2015 rate of effectiveness for flu shots was 23% in the U.S., and that the \nshots offered no significant protection in Canada. A related finding published by researchers at the \nNational Institutes of Health documented that, although the percentage of seniors who received flu \nshots in recent decades rose from 15% to 65%, the deaths caused by influenza among the elderly \ncontinued to climb during this period. These researchers concluded either the vaccine failed to \nprotect the elderly against mortality... and/or the vaccination efforts did not adequately target the \nfrailest elderly. \n \nMore recent research has tried to develop a method to assess in advance whether a given flu vaccine \nwould have any protection benefit. A report published in 2016 in the journal Nature Immunology used \na blood assay and identified a correlation between persons with a certain pattern of gene expression \nand the likelihood that such persons would experience adverse events after receiving a flu vaccine. If \nthis assay could be made economical, and included in blood tests typically done in annual physicals, it \ncould reduce the number of suits filed with the federal Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. With \nthese reports in mind, consider the following case: \n \nDr. Jones works in a hospital and she recently became aware of all the above reports. She belongs to \nthe American Medical Association (AMA), which strongly recommends that everyone receive flu shots \neach year. Moreover, her hospital recently informed her that she herself must take annual flu shots or \nrisk termination of her hospital privileges or employment. Dr. Jones, however, is aware of the AMA \nCode of Ethics, which states that patients have a right of self-decision regarding their health care, and \nthat this right can only be effectively exercised if the patient possesses enough information to enable \nan informed choice. She feels a moral obligation to inform her senior patients that she has \nreservations about the efficacy of flu shots for their age group and why.  \n \nSince the AMA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are strong proponents of annual flu \nshots, if Dr. Jones gives contrary advice to her patients, this could jeopardize her standing with the \nAMA, in addition to her employment at her hospital. Furthermore, her hospital administrator and \nother health officials are concerned that if doctors advise patients about the relative ineffectiveness of, \nand potential injury from, flu vaccines, this could feed public doubts about the efficacy or safety of \nother vaccines. Such doubts could increase public opposition \nto new state laws that aim to promote herd immunity by \nmandating certain vaccinations. \n \nWhile the case of Dr. Jones is based on the actual experiences \nof a medical doctor, her name and identifying details have \nbeen changed.

      "content": "Case Study - Cheney vs. U.S. District Court - Page 1 of 3 \nCheney v. U.S. District Court \n \nOn June 24, 2004, the United States Supreme Court decided the case of Cheney v. U.S. District \nCourt.  Believing that U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney's handling of an energy task force violated \nthe Federal Advisory Committee Act, and suspecting undue influence in governmental \ndeliberations by the energy industry, two environmental groups--the Sierra Club and Judicial \nWatch--sued to discover official documents relating to the meetings.  Cheney and other \ngovernment defendants moved to dismiss the lawsuit, but the federal district court in Washington \nD.C. ordered defendants to produce information about the task force. Defendants appealed, and \nthe Circuit Court also held that they had to turn over the information. Defendants appealed again \nto the Supreme Court. A majority of the Supreme Court, for largely procedural reasons, held that \nthe Circuit Court should reconsider the appeal in light of new legal guidelines that the Supreme \nCourt set out. Dissenters argued that the lower courts had ruled correctly, and the case should be \nreturned to the District Court where it could go forward.  Justice Antonin Scalia voted with the \nmajority, but also said that he favored dismissing the case and ruling for Cheney and the other \ndefendants. Justice Scalia also filed a statement explaining why he was refusing requests that he \nrecuse himself from the case.   \n  \nJustice Scalia's opinion in favor of Cheney was controversial. While the case against Cheney was \npending, Scalia had taken a widely publicized duck hunting trip with defendant Cheney and others.  \nFederal law states that any justice or judge shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his \nimpartiality might be questioned. Critics of Justice Scalia thought it reasonable to question his \nimpartiality. Stephen Gillers, a New York University law professor and expert on legal ethics, noted, \nA judge may have a friendship with a lawyer, and that's fine. But if the lawyer has a case before \nthe judge, they don't socialize until it's over. That shows a proper respect for maintaining the \npublic's confidence in the integrity of the process. \n \n \nDefenders of Justice Scalia argued that these criticisms were politically motivated by people \nwho wished that Scalia not be able to vote in the case. They said it is common for justices to be \nfriends with political actors who might be involved in cases coming before the Court. Defending his \nactions, Scalia stated, Social contacts with high-level executive officials...have never been thought \nimproper for judges who may have before them cases in \nwhich those people are involved... For example, Supreme \nCourt Justices are regularly invited to dine at the White \nHouse, whether or not a suit seeking to compel or prevent \ncertain presidential action is pending. \n \n \n \nResources:\n \n28 U.S.C. sec. 455(a) - Disqualification of Justice, Judge, or Magistrate Judge \nhttps://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/granule/USCODE-2011-title28/USCODE-2011-title28-partI-chap21-\nsec455/content-detail.html \n \nCheney, Vice President of the United States, et al. v.

      "title": "Abramoff-Lobbying-Congress",
      "content": "Abramoff: Lobbying Congress\nOn March 29, 2006, former lobbyist Jack Abramoff was sentenced to six years in federal prison after pleading guilty to mail fraud, tax evasion, and conspiracy to bribe public officials. Key to Abramoff's conviction were his lobbying efforts that began in the 1990s on behalf of Native American tribes seeking to establish gambling on reservations.\nIn 1996, Abramoff began working for the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians. With the help of Republican tax reform advocate Grover Norquist, and his political advocacy group Americans for Tax Reform, Abramoff defeated a Congressional bill that would have taxed Native American casinos. Texas Representative and House Majority Whip Tom DeLay also played a major role in the bill's defeat. DeLay pushed the agenda of Abramoff's lobbying clients in exchange for favors from Abramoff.\n\nIn 1999, Abramoff similarly lobbied to defeat a bill in the Alabama State Legislature that would have allowed casino-style games on dog racing tracks. This bill would have created competition for his clients' casino businesses. Republican political activist Ralph Reed, and his political consulting firm Century Strategies, aided the effort by leading a grassroots campaign that rallied Alabama-based Christian organizations to oppose the bill.\nAs Abramoff's successes grew, his clients, political contacts, and influence expanded. He hired aides and former staff of members of Congress. In 2001, Abramoff began working with Congressman DeLay's former communications director, Michael Scanlon, who had formed his own public affairs consulting firm, Capitol Campaign Strategies. The Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana hired Abramoff and Capitol Campaign Strategies to help them renegotiate their gambling agreement with the State of Louisiana.\nAbramoff, however, did not disclose to the tribe that, in addition to his own consulting fees, he also received a portion of the fees paid to Scanlon's firm.\nIn an effort to protect his Coushatta clients in Louisiana from competition by a new casino near Houston, Texas, Abramoff successfully lobbied for a state gambling ban in Texas between 2001 and 2002. Incidental to this ban was the closure of a casino in El Paso, Texas, owned by the Tigua Tribal Nation. The Tigua were another one of Abramoff's casino clients.\nLater in 2002, Abramoff made a pitch to the Tigua to work to oppose the ban for which he had previously lobbied successfully. With the Tigua's money, Abramoff took Ohio Representative Bob Ney and his staff on a golfing trip to Scotland. Abramoff hoped to convince Ney and his colleagues to slip a provision into an election-reform bill that would grant the Tigua gaming rights. Abramoff's efforts did not pay off, and the deal he sought fell through, but he did not inform the Tigua of this outcome. Rather, Abramoff continued to give the Tigua hope for the\n \nprovision's success, while also continuing to charge them for his and Scanlon's services. And, in their email exchanges, Abramoff and Scanlon often mocked their tribal clients as morons and monkeys.\nThroughout the course of their work with Native American tribes, Abramoff and Scanlon charged upwards of $66 million. The Coushatta paid over $30 million to protect their casino and to stop competing casinos in Texas. The Tigua paid $4.2 million to try to continue operating their casino in Texas. Abramoff has stated that he donated much of the money he made to charities, schools, and causes he believed in. But he also spent millions of dollars on activities or contributions in connection with politicians and campaigns he sought to influence. Furthermore, he evaded taxes by funneling money through nonprofit organizations with which he partnered.\nAfter his conviction in 2006, Abramoff cooperated in the investigation of his relationships with Congress members, including aides, business associates, government officials, and lawmakers. Representatives DeLay and Ney both stepped down from their positions in Congress. DeLay, who had risen to the rank of House Majority Leader, was charged with money laundering and conspiracy of funneling corporate contributions to state candidates. Ney plead guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud and making false statements. In exchange for gifts, lavish trips, and political donations from Abramoff, DeLay and Ney had used their positions in Congress to grant favors to Abramoff's clients and lobbying team. Abramoff served three and a half years of a six-year prison term. He was released on December 3, 2010.\n\nSince his release, Abramoff has spoken out against corruption in politics. He has stated that he believed himself to be a moral lobbyist and has apologized for his actions. In a 2011 interview, he said, What's legal in this system is the problem, and in his memoir, he wrote, Unfortunately, I was a miniature version of that system. But not everyone perceived his redemption as a genuine effort.\nTigua tribal leaders said his apologies were too little, too late. Rick Hill, former chairman of the Oneida Nation of Wisconsin, stated, You look at Jack--though he took money from my elders and our kids, and now he comes here, and he gets to prop himself up, and it's an acceptable part of [Washington]\nD.C. culture. He wouldn't stand a minute on the reservation.\nOthers point to the American political system, and see Abramoff as a symptom of broader corruption. Investigative journalist Susan Schmidt stated, Abramoff couldn't have flourished if this system, itself, was not corrupt, where the need for money--the members of Congress and their need for money--is so voracious and so huge that they don't have their guard up. California Representative Dana Rohrabacher said, What Jack had been doing was what had been done before. People should pay more attention to the fact that we have got some enormous special interests in this country who are having incredible influences on policy.\nIn his memoir, Abramoff reflected on personal and professional reform: Regardless of my rationalizations, I was the one who didn't disclose to my clients that there was a conflict of interest... I wasn't the devil that the media were so quick to create, but neither was I the saint I always hoped to become. ...I decided that, in order to move myself close to the angels, I would take what happened in my life, try to learn from it, and use it to educate others.",

      "title": "AstrosSignStealingScandal_English",
      "content": "The Astros' Sign-Stealing Scandal\nMajor League Baseball (MLB) fosters an extremely competitive environment. Tens of millions\nof dollars in salary (and endorsements) can hang in the balance, depending on whether a player\nperforms well or poorly. Likewise, hundreds of millions of dollars of value are at stake for the\nowners as teams vie for World Series glory. Plus, fans, players and owners just want their team\nto win. And everyone hates to lose!\nIt is no surprise, then, that the history of big-time baseball is dotted with cheating scandals\nranging from the Black Sox scandal of 1919 (Say it ain't so, Joe!), to Gaylord Perry's spitter, to\nthe corked bats of Albert Belle and Sammy Sosa, to the widespread use of performance\nenhancing drugs (PEDs) in the 1990s and early 2000s. Now, the Houston Astros have joined this\ninglorious list.\nCatchers signal to pitchers which type of pitch to throw, typically by holding down a certain\nnumber of fingers on their non-gloved hand between their legs as they crouch behind the plate.\nIt is typically not as simple as just one finger for a fastball and two for a curve, but not a lot\nmore complicated than that.\nIn September 2016, an Astros intern named Derek Vigoa gave a PowerPoint presentation to\ngeneral manager Jeff Luhnow that featured an Excel-based application that was programmed\nwith an algorithm. The algorithm was designed to (and could) decode the pitching signs that\nopposing teams' catchers flashed to their pitchers. The Astros called it Codebreaker. One\nAstros employee referred to the sign-\nstealing system that evolved as the dark\narts.1\nMLB rules allowed a runner standing on\nsecond base to steal signs and relay them\nto the batter, but the MLB rules strictly\nforbade using electronic means to\ndecipher signs. The Astros' Codebreaker\nblatantly violated these rules.\nAccording to Wall Street Journal writer Jared Diamond:\nThe way Codebreaker worked was simple: Somebody would watch an in-game live feed\nand log the catcher's signals into the spreadsheet, as well as the type of pitch that was\nactually thrown. With that information, Codebreaker determined how the signs\ncorresponded with different pitches. Once decided, that information would be\ncommunicated through intermediaries to a baserunner, who would relay them to the\nhitter.\nCase Study - The Astros' Sign Stealing Scandal - Page 1 of 8\nStarting around June 2017, the system was embellished by Astros players. They started\nwatching a live game feed on a monitor near the dugout and then would bang on a trash\ncan to communicate the coming pitch to the batter. The banging scheme lasted\nthrough the 2017 World Series, which the Astros won over the Los Angeles Dodgers.2\nThis all occurred despite the fact that late in the 2017 season, MLB caught the Boston Red Sox\nrelaying signs from their video room to an Apple watch worn by a trainer sitting in the dugout.\nMLB Commissioner Rob Manfred fined the Red Sox and issued a strong warning to all teams\nagainst illegal electronic sign-stealing.3\nHowever, the Astros' scheme lasted into the 2018 season in away games as well as home\ngames, despite the fact that other teams were very suspicious that the Astros were stealing\nsigns. Other teams often changed their own signs several times a game in an attempt to thwart\nthe Astros suspected sign stealing. An executive for an opposing team was quoted as saying\nThe whole industry knows they've been cheating their asses off for three or four years.\nEverybody knew it.4 Indeed, many teams had complained to MLB's executives about the\nAstros' cheating. Some suspect the cheating continued through the 2019 season although\nothers think not, and MLB found no convincing evidence of it.5\nSign-stealing might not seem like it would give a big advantage. After all, even if a batter knows\nthat a certain pitch is coming, he still has to hit it. And it is not easy hitting a 100-mph fastball\nor a major league-caliber slider, even if you know it's coming. Nonetheless, the advantage is\nsubstantial. According to the Washington Nationals' pitching coach Paul Menhart, It's the\nworst feeling in the world stepping on that mound and having an idea that the hitter knows\nwhat's coming. It's one of the most unnerving feelings. You feel helpless. You just get ticked\noff to the point where you lose total focus and confidence.6 The Washington Nationals won\nthe 2019 World Series over the favored Astros. They won, at least in part, by assuming that the\nAstros would be attempting to steal their signs, and putting into place elaborate\ncountermeasures, including multiple sets of signs for each pitcher.7\nThere is no question that many of the Astros players were actively involved in the scheme. The\nAstros manager, AJ Hinch, clearly knew about it. There is substantial, though perhaps not\nairtight evidence, that General Manager (GM) Rob Luhnhow also knew of the scheme. Carlos\nBeltran, a Hall-of-Fame caliber player near the end of his 20-year playing career was a leader in\nthe scheme. And bench coach Alex Cora was a primary instigator. Owner Jim Crane appears\nnot to have known of the dark arts being practiced by his club.8\nThe scandal became public on November 12, 2019, when former Astros' pitcher Mike Fiers\nblew the whistle in an interview published in The Athletic.9 Although some current MLB\nplayers praised Fiers for coming forward about the scandal, other players criticized him for\nviolating baseball's presumed code of silence, also called the clubhouse code.10 MLB then\nlaunched an investigation that granted the Astros players immunity in return for their fessing\nup. Commissioner Rob Manfred soon issued a nine-page report that found that most of the\nAstros players knew of the scheme and many participated in it. The report said that manager\nCase Study - The Astros' Sign Stealing Scandal - Page 2 of 8\nHinch knew of the scheme and that GM Luhnow should have prevented it.11 Commissioner\nManfred suspended both Hinch and Luhnow, who were quickly fired by Astros' owner Crane.\nMLB fined the Astros $5 million, and stripped the club of its first- and second-round draft picks\nin both 2020 and 2021.12\nThere was other fall-out, too. Beltran, who had just been hired as manager of the New York\nMets, was fired. Cora, who had subsequently become the manager of the Boston Red Sox, was\nalso fired. In late April 2020, Manfred found that the Red Sox had done some illicit sign-stealing\nin the 2018 season. Surprisingly, though, he concluded that manager Cora and most of the Red\nSox players did not know about it. Manfred imposed a modest punishment on the Red Sox\norganization in the form of a lost draft pick. But again, none of the players who participated in\nthe scheme were penalized.13\nManfred's decision not to punish players was harshly criticized by many. He claimed that\ngranting immunity in exchange for information was the best way to quickly discover the truth.\nThis approach was praised by some,14 but other observers were unconvinced.15 He also argued\nthat it was difficult to determine how much advantage the cheating scandal had given the\nAstros. However, many major league players - including the game's best player, Mike Trout -\nsuggested that they would love to know what pitch was coming.16 Manfred also claimed that\nwith so many players involved to different degrees, it would be difficult to apportion blame\nappropriately. Additionally, MLB had stated in its 2017 warning about sign-stealing that it would\nhold management responsible for violations.17\nSome suggested that Manfred was simply trying to minimize damage to MLB's image. The game\ngot a black eye from the PED scandal, which is brought back into the spotlight every year as\nBarry Bonds, Roger Clemens, and others are refused entry to the baseball Hall of Fame by\nsportswriters who insist on punishing their cheating in ways that MLB never did. And Astros\nplayers such as Carlos Correa, Jose Altuve, and Justin Verlander will probably have a better\nchance to enter the Hall of Fame than if they had been suspended for cheating.18\nThe damage done by the Astros is significant. Former major leaguer Doug Glanville said the\nAstros' selfish act makes everyone question the validity of the future and the truth of the\npast, concluding that MLB now faces an existential crisis.19 Veteran catcher Stephen Vogt\nsaid, The integrity of our game is what we have, and now that's been broken.20\nThe impact on the Astros and its players, beyond a new manager and general manager, is as yet\nunknown. The Astros worry that opposing pitchers will feel some degree of freedom to throw\nat Astros hitters. A former major league pitcher, Mike Bolsinger, sued the Astros. He claimed\nthat a particularly bad outing he had was caused by the Astros' cheating, and that it effectively\nended his MLB career.21 The effect of their cheating ways can be seen in non-professional\nbaseball, too, with some little leagues banning the use of Astros as a team name.22 Regardless\nof league level, gaming the system to advantage one's own team is not the kind of play that, in\nthe long run, makes for good sport.\nCase Study - The Astros' Sign Stealing Scandal - Page 3 of 8",

These are a great group of guys who did not receive proper guidance from their leaders.28 It does appear that GM Luhnhow did know generally of the scheme, that field manager Hinch definitely knew about it (and did not like it) but did little or nothing to stop it, and that bench coach Alex Cora and team elder Carlos Beltran were active leaders of the scheme. Does that absolve the other players? Why or why not?",

I had never been part of a major-league clubhouse. Maybe what they did was the norm, I have no idea. I had never been in another big-league clubhouse.29 Does this sound like the conformity bias in action, or just another excuse? Explain your reasoning.",

      "content": "Cardinals' Computer Hacking\nChris Correa was a computer whiz who loved sports and worked in the scouting department of the St.\nLouis Cardinals. His skills and judgment led him to be promoted, and he became the Cardinals' scouting\ndirector in charge of the amateur draft.\nIn 2011, two of Correa's colleagues, who were higher up in the Cardinal's management, left the team\nto take top jobs with a rival team - the Houston Astros. Jeff Luhnow became the Astros' general\nmanager and Sig Mejdal took the job of director of decisions sciences. Correa now says that he was\nworried that these men might have taken important information, including data and algorithms that\nthe Cardinals had spent a lot of time and money to develop, to the Astros. And he thought they might\nbe using the information against the Cardinals.\nOne day, Correa guessed Mejdal's password and used it to hack into the Astros' webmail system. He\naccessed the Astros' webmail at least 48 times (sometimes for as long as two hours at a time) over the\nnext few years. He stole information, such as the Astros' scouting reports, draft rankings, and trade\ndiscussions. Correa also took steps to cover up his actions. But eventually, he was discovered. In 2014,\nit appears that Correa leaked internal Astros' trade talk notes to the prominent sports blog Deadspin,\nwhich caused the Astros to realize that their system had been compromised.\nThe FBI was called in. After some investigation, the U.S. Department of Justice charged Correa with five\nviolations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Correa pled guilty in early 2016 and was sentenced to\n46 months in prison. He was ordered to pay the Astros $279,038 in restitution. Later, the Major\nLeague Baseball (MLB) Commissioner, Rob Manfred, imposed a lifetime ban on Correa from working in\nMLB. Manfred also fined the Cardinals $2 million, although there is no solid evidence that anyone\nother than Correa was involved in the hacking.\nAt his sentencing, Correa signed a document admitting that he had caused $1.7 million worth of losses\nto the Astros. However, whatever damage Correa did failed to prevent the Astros from being one of\nMLB's best teams from (at least) 2016 to 2022. The Astros won the World Series in 2017 and returned\nto the Series, but lost, in 2019 and 2021.\nWhen Correa was interviewed in prison, he could not remember where he had been (at home? in his\nCardinals' office?) when he had first hacked into the Astros' internal database. And when interviewed\nin prison by sportswriter Ben Reiter, Correa later tried\nto reconstruct his crime, asking: Why am I here?\nCase Study - Cardinals' Computer Hacking - Page 1 of 3",
      "questions": [
        "1. Reiter writes: While [Correa] knew what he was doing wasn't right, he never thought that it could be a crime. 'It was all in the context of a game, to me,' he says. 'When a pitcher throws at a batter's chest, nobody runs to the local authorities and tries to file an assault charge. I'm not making excuses. I'm trying to explain where my head was at, as I now understand it. If another team does something wrong, you retaliate. That's the lens through which I mistakenly viewed it, and I used that to give myself permission. It was wrong.' It appears that Correa did not have ethics in his frame of reference when he launched his hacking scheme. Does it appear to you that he had a framing problem? Explain.",
        "2. Is the fact that Correa was involved in a competition at the highest levels of baseball provide sufficient justification for his violating moral standards and/or the law? 1. If you suspect that someone has broken into your house and stolen something, are you morally and/or legally justified in breaking into their house to see if you can locate your stuff there? The judge who sentenced Correa didn't think so. Do you? Why or why not?",
        "3. Reiter also writes: There is another theory to explain Correa's actions. It is that even if his intrusions came from a feeling that the Cardinals had themselves been violated, he used that to justify behavior that turned into something like a compulsion, rooted in both voyeurism and the fact that the information acquired by illicitly peering into a chief rival's brain--and seeing the basis for every decision it made--provided an undeniable advantage to both the Cardinals and his own career. If you have viewed the video on the self-serving bias, would you think that it might sometimes provide subconscious motivation for people to downplay ethics--to drop it out of their frame of reference-- when they make decisions? Explain why or why not.",
        "4. Later, Correa had a realization: What was really surreal to me was when I stood back and recognized how essentially disrespectful my behavior was of the people whose privacy I violated. If you are blind to the impact that your actions have on others, do you automatically have a framing problem? Explain.",
        "5. At the end of the day, Correa seems to be another good person who did a bad thing and has paid a serious price. At sentencing, he said that this was the worst thing I've done in my life by far, and I am overwhelmed with remorse and regret. Famed player and coach Leo Durocher once said: Winning isn't everything. It's the only thing. Did Durocher also have a framing problem? Was he right, or should winning with honor be the only thing? What is your view? Explain.

There was intense public pressure to solve the case and, indeed, the police\nquickly arrested five young (14 to 16 years old) men who were black and Latino. They had been part of\na larger group of young men harassing passersby in another part of the park.\nAfter intense interrogations ranging from 14 to 30 hours in length, four of the five confessed to the\ncrime. The five were charged with the attack. Importantly, (a) the boys soon recanted their\nconfessions which they blamed on police coercion, (b) no physical evidence linked the young men to\nthe crime, (c) no physical evidence indicated that there was more than one attacker, (d) the semen\nfound in the victim did not match any of the young men, and (e) the four confessions were inconsistent\nwith each other and with the physical evidence from the crime scene. Nonetheless, the young men\nwere convicted and sent to jail. Real estate developer Donald Trump called for their swift execution in\na full-page newspaper ad.\nThirteen years later, Matias Reyes, who was serving a life sentence for murder, confessed to the crime.\nIndeed, his DNA matched the semen recovered from the victim. His was the only semen recovered\nfrom the victim. The attack on the jogger was similar in M.O. to his other rapes, none of which\ninvolved any other perpetrator.\nEventually the Central Park 5 settled a wrongful\nconviction lawsuit with the City of New York for\n$41 million.\nHowever, the indisputable and overwhelming\nevidence of their innocence did not change the\nminds of:\n The lead prosecutor, who claimed that the five young men were indeed still guilty and that\nReyes was simply an additional perpetrator--an unindicted co-ejaculator.\n The head detective, who said: 'This lunatic [Reyes] concocts this wild story and these people fell\nfor it.\n Donald Trump who in 2013 tweeted regarding Ken Burns' award-winning documentary on the\nCentral Park 5's innocence: The Central Park Five documentary was a one sided piece of\ngarbage that didn't explain the horrific crimes of these young men while in park.\n The second chair lawyer in the prosecution who in 2018 still finds the taped confessions pretty\ncompelling notwithstanding their inconsistencies and the fact that of the first 325 DNA\nexonerations in the U.S., 27% involved false confessions.\nCase Study - The Central Park Five - Page 1 of 3",

      "title": "Cover-Up-on-Campus_Overconfidence-Bias_Case-Study_English-1",
      "content": "Case Study - Cover-Up On Campus - Page 1 of 6 \n \nCover-Up On Campus \nArt Briles is without question one of the best high school football coaches in the history of \nTexas high school football. Starting as an assistant coach at a small town, his intelligence, drive, \nattention to detail, and creativity led him to head coaching jobs at larger and larger schools. He \nturned a floundering program at Stephenville High School into a powerhouse that won multiple \nstate championships and intimidated even much larger high schools' football teams. \nNot without ambition, Briles then took an assistant coaching job at Texas Tech University and \nsoon became a successful head coach at the University of Houston. Then, he took the top job at \nBaylor University. Baylor is an unambiguously Christian university. Its website read (at the \ntime): In a world where faith is often the casualty of a serious pursuit of academic \nachievement, Baylor is a special case. Baylor's chancellor and president, Ken Starr, was an \nenthusiastic promoter of Christian values. Baylor's athletic director, Ian McCaw, was described \nby former Clemson football coach Tommy Bowden as a fine Christian man.  \nBriles seemed like a good fit for Baylor. As Briles often explains, his Christian faith is very \nimportant to him. A columnist wrote that Briles was polite, courteous, and respectful in a way \nthat harkens back to a different era. He is a good man with a good family. Baylor used its \nChristian values, as embodied in its Christian leaders, as a lure to recruit students, and student-\nathletes. \nIn 2008, Briles began as Baylor's head football coach with the goal of ending a 12-year-string of \nlosing records. It was a struggle during the first two years. But Briles' recruiting ability, coaching \nacumen, and endless energy soon revived the dormant program. In 2010, Baylor had a winning \nrecord and went to its first of six straight bowl games. Soon after, Baylor became a team that \nwas annually in the conversation for the nation's best team. Baylor sent numerous players to \nthe NFL and their quarterback, Robert Griffin III, won the Heisman trophy. \nOn the surface, all seemed well on the Baylor campus, especially at its brand-new $266 million \nfootball stadium. The campus was abuzz with energy and excitement over the football team's \nsuccess, which is not surprising in Texas. In 2013, Nick Eatman published Art Briles: Looking Up: \nMy Journey from Tragedy to Triumph. And in 2014, Briles wrote and published an \nautobiography, Beating Goliath: My Story of Football and Faith.  \nBut all was not well on the Baylor campus. In November 2014, Briles published his \nautobiography and the football team went 11-\n2. Baylor rose to as high as #4 in the national \nrankings. The same year, Patty Crawford was \nnamed Baylor's first full-time Title IX \ncoordinator. In her first two years in that role, \nCrawford received 400 reports of sexual \nharassment, violence, and assault. Seventeen \nof those victims made complaints of sexual \nassault or domestic violence against nineteen \n\n \nCase Study - Cover-Up On Campus - Page 2 of 6 \n \nfootball players, including four alleged gang rapes. Crawford said that cases involving football \nplayers involved 10% of her caseload even though football players constituted only 4% of the \nstudent body. Lawsuits later alleged 52 rapes by 31 football players from 2011 to 2014.  \nAccording to Paula Lavigne and Mark Schlabach in their book Violated: Exposing Rape at Baylor \nUniversity Amid College Football's Sexual Assault Crisis, Crawford said (regarding the gang \nrapes): ...the younger guys saw what was happening and that no one ever got in trouble for it, \nand the behavior continued. 'It was just this weird mentality at Baylor that I haven't seen \nanywhere else.' \nThroughout Briles' tenure at Baylor, women were assaulted by football players. Not much was \ndone if these women complained to the university. This, of course, discouraged others from \ncomplaining so the incidents piled up.  \nThe evidence indicates that Baylor's chancellor Starr was largely unaware of what was going on. \nHis fault lay primarily in not giving attention to ensuring that Baylor was meeting its Title IX \nobligations to police, investigate, and punish such wrongdoing. As president and chancellor, this \nwas ultimately Starr's obligation. \nBriles mostly claimed ignorance. He apologized to the board of regents for not knowing what \nwas going on, although there was quite a bit of evidence that he did know. Many students and \nparents claimed to have made complaints to the football program. But Briles, who seemed to \nhave a good memory when he wrote his autobiography, repeatedly said that he had no \nmemory of complaints, messages, or conversations that victims claimed occurred. But e-mails \nand text messages surfaced which showed that Briles often knew of complaints and did his best \nto ensure that they were kept quiet rather than alert university officials in the Title IX office as \nhe was supposed to do. Baylor's athletic director McCaw sometimes did the same.  \nIn one instance, a football player was arrested for assaulting and threatening to kill a male \nstudent (a non-athlete). In response, Briles and McCaw exchanged these messages: \nBRILES: Just talked to [the player]--he said Waco PD was there--said they were going to \nkeep it quiet--Wasn't a set up deal... I'll get shill [Baylor director of football operations \nColin Shillinglaw] to ck on Sibley [a defense attorney often used by Baylor football \nplayers]. \nMcCAW: That would be great if they kept it quiet! \nWhen these cases began showing up in the press, Baylor could no longer play the silent game. \nThe Board of Regents took charge and hired a law firm, Pepper Hamilton, to investigate. Its \nreport was not pretty. Among other factual conclusions that the Board reached after reviewing \nthe Pepper Hamilton report (which it refused to release to the public) were these: \nBaylor failed to maintain effective oversight and supervision of the Athletics Department \nas it related to the effective implementation of Title IX. Leadership challenges and \n\n \nCase Study - Cover-Up On Campus - Page 3 of 6 \n \ncommunication issues hindered enforcement of rules and policies, and created a \ncultural perception that football was above the rules.... \nBaylor failed to take appropriate action to respond to reports of sexual assault and \ndating violence reportedly committed by football players. The choices made by football \nstaff and athletics leadership, in some instances, posed a risk to campus safety and the \nintegrity of the University. In certain instances, including reports of a sexual assault by \nmultiple football players, athletics and football personnel affirmatively chose not to \nreport sexual violence and dating violence to an appropriate administrator outside of \nathletics. In those instances, football coaches or staff met directly with a complainant \nand/or a parent of a complainant and did not report the misconduct. As a result, no \naction was taken to support complainants, fairly and impartially evaluate the conduct \nunder Title IX, address identified cultural concerns within the football program or \nprotect campus safety once aware of a potential pattern of sexual violence by multiple \nfootball players. \nIn addition, some football coaches and staff took improper steps in response to disclosures of \nsexual assault or dating violence that precluded the University from fulfilling its legal \nobligations. Football staff conducted their own untrained internal inquiries, outside of policy, \nwhich improperly discredited complainants and denied them the right to a fair, impartial and \ninformed investigation, interim measures or processes promised under University Policy. In \nsome cases, internal steps gave the illusion of responsiveness to complainants but failed to \nprovide a meaningful institutional response under Title IX. Further, because reports were not \nshared outside of athletics, the University missed critical opportunities to impose appropriate \ndisciplinary action that would have removed offenders from campus and possibly precluded \nfuture acts of sexual violence against Baylor students. In some instances, the football program \ndismissed players for unspecified team violations and assisted them in transferring to other \nschools.... \nIn addition to the failures related to sexual assault and dating violence, individuals within the \nfootball program actively sought to maintain internal control over discipline for other forms of \nmisconduct. Athletics personnel failed to recognize the conflicts of interest in roles and risk to \ncampus safety by insulating athletes from student conduct processes. Football coaches and \nstaff took affirmative steps to maintain internal control over discipline of players and to actively \ndivert cases from the student conduct or criminal processes. In some cases, football coaches \nand staff had inappropriate involvement in disciplinary and criminal matters or engaged in \nimproper conduct that reinforced an overall perception that football was above the rules, and \nthat there was no culture of accountability for misconduct.  \nThe regents ultimately fired or forced the resignations of Starr, McCaw, and Briles. \n \n \n\n \nCase Study - Cover-Up On Campus - Page 4 of 6 \n \nBibliography:\nArt Briles & Don Yaeger, Beating Goliath: My Story of Football and Faith (2014).  \nNick Eatman, Art Briles: Looking Up: My Journey from Tragedy to Triumph (2013). \nLisa Maria Garza, Baylor Removes Starr as President, Will Fire Coach Over Rape Case, New \nYork Times, May 26, 2016. \nPaula Lavigne & Mark Schlabach, Violated: Exposing Rape at Baylor University Amid College \nFootball's Sexual Assault Crisis (2017).  \nLisa Maria Garza, Baylor Removes Starr as President, Will Fire Coach Over Rape Case, New \nYork Times, May 26, 2016. \nAdam Kilgore & Nick Anderson, Art Briles's Stunning Ascent Ends in Sudden Disgrace Following \nDamning Report, Washington Post, May 26, 2016. \nPaul Newberry, Baylor Should Pull Plug on Its Athletic Program, Associated Press, May 26, \n2016. \n \nAuthor: \nRobert Prentice, J.D. \nDepartment of Business, Government and Society \nMcCombs School of Business \nThe University of Texas at Austin",
      "questions": [
        "1. Many friends and family members will swear that Starr, McCaw, and Briles are, indeed, fine Christian men. Hundreds of former players will swear to coach Briles' character. Briles, Starr and McCaw were confident in their conduct. Briles said: I like the way we've handled [the scandal] as a university, an athletic department, and a football program.  Yet they, especially Briles and McCaw, seem to have made serious moral mistakes in their handling of this scandal. Could the overconfidence bias provide a partial explanation for why these good men made bad decisions? Explain. a. Could their confidence in their own character and religiosity have subverted careful moral decision making? Discuss.",
        "2. The video quotes behavioral psychologists Tenbrunsel and Bazerman as writing: It's likely that most of us overestimate our ethicality at one point or another.  In effect, we are unaware of the gap between how ethical we think we are and how ethical we truly are. a. Do you see evidence of that in the Baylor situation? If so, what? b. Have you seen evidence of it in your own life? Explain. c. Are you confident of your own moral character? d. Have you ever made ethical choices that, in retrospect, appear to have been poor ones? How might you have been subject to the overconfidence bias yourself?",
        "3. When people focus too much on one part of the picture, other aspects may fade from view. It seems clear that Starr, McCaw, and Briles were determined to lead Baylor to football prominence. They correctly surmised that athletic success on the field would lead to a financial bonanza for the school--new stadiums, new buildings, record alumni donations. These goals were set and met, but at a terrible price it seems. The moral standards that should have guided the recruiting of football players and the investigations into their wrongdoing faded into the background for these three men who were focused on other accomplishments. Could ethical fading [for a brief definition of this concept, watch: https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/glossary/ethical-fading] also have played a role in the poor decision making that facilitated this scandal? Explain your reasoning.",
        "4. When goals conflict, something has to give. In the case of Baylor, it was arguably the safety and welfare of the campus's female student population. With Starr, McCaw, and Briles being single-mindedly committed to attaining football success (and its attendant benefits), they consciously or unconsciously disregarded and disrespected their campus's young women. Explain how conflicts of interest [for a brief definition, watch: https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/glossary/conflict-of-interest] can give rise to poor ethical decision making. Do you think conflicts of interest may have played a role in this case? If so, how?",
        "5. Most people have a sort of mental scoreboard in their heads where they compare their image of themselves as good people with their actual deeds. So, when we do something we're not exactly proud of, we will often seek opportunities to help others so we can get our mental scales back in balance. This is called moral compensation. Unfortunately, the reverse is also true. When we feel we have done especially well, we often give ourselves permission to do something a little wrong. Our internal moral scoreboard shows a surplus and we give ourselves permission not to live up to our own moral standards.... just this once.  This is called moral licensing. We often see it when high-profile televangelists are caught profiting from their parishioners' contributions, or when family values politicians are caught with prostitutes, or (perhaps) when Christian football coaches are caught excusing the misdeeds of football players they need in order to win the next game. The coaching team at Baylor had been praised for their many successes and their representation of good Christian values. Do you think moral licensing might have played a role in this scandal? If so, how? a. Have you ever been guilty of moral licensing? Discuss. 6. Neither McCaw nor Briles looked himself in the mirror one morning and said: To heck with the safety of young women. I've got football games to win. But human beings are amazing rationalizers. We are very good at finding reasons not to live up to our own standards. A common rationalization in the college sports world, and one that was likely at play at Baylor, is often referred to as altruistic cheating [for a brief definition, watch: https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/glossary/altruistic-cheating]. It doesn't feel so bad to cheat or engage in other wrongdoing if we can say to ourselves that we are doing it to help others and not for purely selfish reasons. Thus, coach Briles could give players a second chance - players whose conduct had gotten them thrown out of other universities - by saying: I feel a duty, a need and a desire to help other people when things aren't going their way. Does the notion of altruistic cheating make sense to you? a. Could altruistic cheating also have played a part in this scandal? If so, how?"

Stroud University of Texas at Austin\n)n 2004, the Associate Press sent a cease-and-desist letter to Bowl Championship Series (BCS) coordinator Kevin Weiberg requesting that the AP's weekly top-25 college football poll be removed from the BCS's formula for determining who plays in the championship game. Citing unauthorized and unlawful use, the AP said they never sanctioned usage of its poll, and that continued inclusion in the BCS formula could undermine the poll's integrity. Since then, the AP poll has been replaced by the (arris )nteractive poll, which includes current and former media members among its 114 voters.\n\nThe BCS is a selection system that creates a series of college football postseason matchups, including a championship game between the top two teams in the country. )t uses a formula that now includes the (arris )nteractive poll and a coaches' poll, as well as computer rankings. Six automatic qualifying (AQ) conferences are guaranteed at least one of the 10 spots in the BCS games, leaving four at-large berths for other highly ranked teams.\n)n general, a team becomes an at-large candidate by finishing the season ranked in the top\n14. Then, the team must be selected by a bowl game's representatives. Being selected for a BCS game offers more than bragging rights; there is financial incentive as well, as money generated from media deals is split among the conferences involved in the games. Conferences with two BCS teams receive a substantially higher payout than those with one or no teams. )n 2011, the BCS distributed $174 million to college football teams; AQ conferences with one BCS team received $21.2 million, and those with two receive an additional $6 million payout.\n\nWhy did the AP ask out of the BCS formula? Doug Robinson of the Deseret News implies an answer: Why is the media involved in this thing? )t's a blatant conflict of interest.\nReporters are supposed to cover the news, not make the news. By participating in polls, they're helping to determine which teams go to bowl games and which teams get millions of dollars.\nESPN also saw potential a conflict of interest with the BCS; in 2005, they removed their sponsorship from the Coaches' Poll, citing lack of transparency. Vince Doria, ESPN's vice president and director of news, explained: We couldn't reconcile having our name on the poll and being able to cover any controversy that might arise. ESPN did not pull their sponsorship from the college basketball version of the coaches' poll.\n\nThere are some notable differences between the AP poll and the (arris poll.

      "content": "Covering Female Athletes\n\nDanee Pye & Scott R. Stroud University of Texas at Austin\n\nIt is difficult to argue with the claim that female athletes receive less coverage than their male counterparts. In addition to considering how often female athletes are covered, journalists must also consider how they are portrayed when they are\ncovered. Sports Illustrated, for example, is known for rarely portraying female\nathletes on its cover, but, on February 8th, 2010, Olympic skier Lyndsey Vonn was featured with the caption America's Best Woman Skier Ever. Although this can be seen as a great moment for Vonn, and for female athletes in general, there were also those who took offense to the skier's positioning in what some have called a sexually provocative pose.\n\n\n\nThe controversy surrounding the picture is two-fold. First, there is disagreement over whether the picture is or is not sexually suggestive. On the cover, Vonn is pictured on a mountain in a tuck position. As multiple commentators noted, male skier, A. J. Kitt, was featured on a 1992 Sports Illustrated cover in a similar pose. However, according to Nicole LaVoi, an expert on women in sports, the images of the\n \n\ntwo skiers differ in that Kitt is portrayed in action, looking forward down the hill, and wearing his helmet. Vonn, however, is clearly posed. She is obviously not moving down the hill. She is also facing the camera and is not wearing her helmet.\n\nThose who find the picture to be offensive argue that it is just another of many examples of the journalistic tendency to portray female athletes as sex objects. Because women athletes receive less coverage, the instances where they are prominently featured are more significant. Portrayals that sexualize female athletes reinforce traditional gender norms and downplay female athletic ability. Photos like Vonn's, they argue, may sell magazines, but they only work to increase interest in her body, not her athleticism.\n\nThose who are not offended by the image either do not see any sexual connotations, or do not find the combination of sex and women's sports to be problematic. Wendy Parker, a sports journalist, does not see anything provocative in the Sport Illustrated image, and she even points out that Vonn is fully clothed from head to toe. Then there are those who argue that it doesn't matter even if it is a sexy picture. Sports Illustrated has a predominately male readership, so it may be a business-boosting ploy to promote reader interest in female competitive skiing. Additionally, female athletes have a right to celebrate their bodies without being told how to behave. As sports blogger Chris Chase asks, Why can't she be both the best skier in the world and really, really attractive too?",
      "questions": [
        "1.\tDid Sports Illustrated do something ethically wrong in running the Vonn picture as they did? If they did, would it matter what their actual intentions behind running the photo were?

Stroud University of Texas at Austin\nWith the widespread use of social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter, the line between private speech and public speech has become increasingly blurred. Although most people are free to speak their minds online, public figures face unique challenges. Even if the First Amendment protects most Facebook posts and tweets, some feel that as public figures athletes have a responsibility to think before they speak--online. For example, Rashard Mendenhall, a running back for the Pittsburgh Steelers, came under attack for tweeting his thoughts about Americans celebrating the assassination of Osama Bin Laden.\n\nAfter some Americans greeted news of the killing of Bin Laden with cheers, Mendenhall tweeted: What kind of person celebrates death? and It's amazing how people can HATE a man they have never even heard speak. We've only heard one side. Public response was immediate. Mendenhall's tweets resulted in a spike from 13,621 to 36,914 in his Twitter followers and a backlash from people who found his statement inappropriate or offensive. Many called for a full and complete apology, and the athletic company Champion dropped him as an endorser, stating that he would not be able to appropriately represent Champion. Champion further explained Mendenhall's statements reflected values inconsistent with those of the brand, and Champion is a strong supporter of the government's efforts to fight terrorism and is very appreciative of the dedication and commitment of the U.S. Armed Forces.

I don't believe that this is an issue of politics or American pride; but one of religion, morality, and human ethics. Nevertheless, he did issue an apology in a later tweet, stating I apologize for the timing as such a sensitive matter, but it was not meant to do harm. He also wrote, I apologize to anyone I unintentionally harmed with anything that I said, or any hurtful interpretation that was made and put to my name.

Those were the words of Steve Spurrier, head football coach at the University of South Carolina, explaining his decision to ban his\nplayers rom Twitter, a micro-blogging service that enables users to send short, public\nmessages in real-time. Spurrier added: A couple of guys put some sort of nasty stuff on there in the summer...so we said, 'You don't need to do that anymore. Let your girlfriend or pal down the street do all the tweeting or whatever it is.\n\nSpurrier's decision was based in part on a June 2011 event involving a member of his team. A former player of Spurrier's tweeted that Alshon Jeffery, a star wide receiver for the Gamecocks, was arrested after being involved in a bar fight. In fact, Jeffery was not involved in a fight or arrested at all. But Spurrier was forced to do damage control with the media.\n\nThere are plenty of examples of questionable social media use by college athletes. Texas lineman Buck Burnette posted a derogatory Facebook message after Barack Obama's 2008 election victory (All the hunters gather up, we have a (slur) in the White House.) and was swiftly dismissed from the team. Will Hill, a football player at Florida, posted a series of\nvulgar tweets about drugs, sex and his dislike of university-provided meals, then later\nclaimed: Somehow my thing has been hacked. North Carolina defensive lineman Marven Austin posted pictures of a luxury vacation in Miami; within weeks, the NCAA announced an investigation into North Carolina players--including Austin--receiving illegal benefits\nfrom agents. And four female soccer players at San Diego state were penalized for posting\nalcohol-related pictures on their Facebook accounts.\n\nSpurrier has not been the only college coach to restrict his players from using Twitter. The first to do so was Boise State football coach Chris Petersen, who has been followed by coaches at programs such as Kansas, Pitt, Mississippi State, and Villanova. Some schools and programs take more moderate approaches. For example, Arizona's athletic department requires all athletes to set their accounts to private. Some schools, like Missouri, include a clause in their student-athlete handbook about honor and dignity in Internet postings.\nOther programs allow their athletes to use social media but monitor their accounts with\nsoftwar that alerts administrators when certain key words show up in posts. One such softwar , UDiligence, monitors Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube accounts for numerous\ncolleges across the country. Founder Kevin Long says the software is meant to protect the students and provide a teaching moment, a mentoring moment to the student.\nStill, college coaches can benefit from the use of Twitter. Many coaches use social media to skirt recruiting rules that limit the amount of times they can text a recruit: It's another vehicle to exchange information, said Santa Clara men's basketball coach Kerry Keating. Recruiting is all about communication and it's another good communication device. And as Bill Reiter, Fox Sports columnist, says: Twitter is nothing more than a modern means of talking. It seems that some coaches feel their players are talking too much.",

      "content": "Sports Blogs: The Wil\tWest of Sports Journalism?\n\nAndrew W. Ishak & Scott R. Stroud University of Texas at Austin\n\nOn August 4, 2010, the popular sports blog Deadspin reported that Brett Favre, a married NFL star known more recently for his constant public flirtation with retirement, made sexual advances on Jenn Sterger, a New York Jets employee and TV personality. In a post titled 'Brett Favre Once Sent Me Cock Shots': Not a Love Story, Deadspin editor A.J. Daulerio printed claims from Sterger that Favre sent her pictures of his genitalia, presumably taken with his cell phone, and that he had also left flirtatious voicemails for her. Daulerio framed the information from Sterger as claims, not fact; Daulerio seemingly wanted more details before assigning full weight to the story. He quotes an email exchange that includes Sterger's plea for confidentiality as well as his own desire to receive, and publish, evidence of Favre's flirtation. As it turns out, Sterger would never provide the material in question nor would she give explicit permission to Daulerio to publish the story.\nDaulerio called his initial post about Favre a bat signal for whoever else had this kind of information to kind of step forward and talking to us. His strategy worked, as Daulerio was soon contacted by Mr. X, an anonymous source who provided photos, text messages and voicemails in question. Daulerio met Mr. X in a New York hotel room and paid up to\n$12,000 in exchange for the materials.\n\nOn October 7, 2010, Deadspin published the photos, texts, and voicemails in a post titled Brett Favre's Cellphone Seduction of Jenn Sterger. The story was intriguing to sports fans as well as the general public; a star athlete, a buxom model, salacious flirtation, and the potential for a suspension levied by the NFL for sexual harassment were more than enough to garner coverage by mainstream news outlets, including ESPN, the New York Post, and the Today show. The NFL's investigation ended in Favre being fined $50,000 for his failure to cooperate in a forthcoming manner. Favre admitted to sending the voicemails, but denied transmission of the photos. As the NFL season shifted to playoff mode, the story moved to the back page of the public consciousness.\n\nHowever, debates about journalistic ethics and sports blogging continued. Many seasoned journalists were quick to point out the chasm between newspaper journalism and the work of websites like Deadspin, or, as ESPN.com Editor-in-Chief Rob King puts it: They're just in a different business with a different mission serving an audience in a different way.\n\nOne debate focused on checkbook journalism, or the concept of paying for stories. Daulerio says the Favre story is only the third time that Deadspin has paid for information. There is no particular fund for paying sources at Gawker Media, Deadspin's parent company; instead, the money is borrowed from the site's budget and must be repaid in traffic increases. Daulerio says his job is to decide whether it's worth it: In this case, I chose right...I don't like to think of it as a business deal, but yes, it worked out very well for\nthe site. There is no question that this particular instance helped Deadspin's traffic. As of\nFebruary 2011, the Favre story on Deadspin has generated over 5 million hits, and Deadspin's monthly readership has increased almost threefold since Daulerio took it over in 2008. Speaking for newspaper journalists, Washington Post columnist Mike Wise says it's just not what we do, although he admits there has been temptation to pay sources for the ratings bump that comes along with exclusive stories.\n\nOthers were concerned with how Daulerio handled the confidentiality of his sources. Sterger initially asked for her name to not be used because she was worried about the potential impact on her budding TV career. Daulerio asked Sterger to change her stance, and he took her non-response to his query to be an indication of her willingness to consent. In the end, he used her name because he felt she was part of the story and he wanted to break the news (he knew Sterger had shared the information with others). Daulerio says the rules of the journalist-source relationship do not apply in this case: I don't think this was a story that falls under any form of 'journalism' whatsoever. This is gossip. Nasty gossip. Deadspin and like-minded sites have, by their own admission, blurred the lines between investigative journalism and the reporting of rumors. Wise says that doesn't matter, stating simply: You don't screw over a source. Daulerio admits that his confidentiality policy is inconsistent, given that he provided anonymity to Mr. X. Favre's reputation was hurt by these allegations, but he continued to focus on football, playing for\nthe Min esota Vikings when these allegations surfaced. When asked for comment before a\ngame against New York, he responded: I'm not getting into that. I've got my hands full with the Jets.",

      "content": "Digital Downloads\nCopyright laws exist to protect authors' and publishers' rights, but also to balance that protection with access and innovation. In 1999, two teenagers created the file-sharing program Napster. Within its first year, the service surpassed 20 million users. Many Napster users shared music files with each other, but without any compensation to the artists and producers who made the music, sparking a series of legal battles over copyright and distribution. In 2001, an appellate panel upheld a previous ruling that Napster violated copyright laws, stating that, Repeated and exploitative unauthorized copies of copyrighted works were made to save the expense of purchasing authorized copies.\n\nArtists were divided on the benefits and harms of Napster. Over 70 artists formed Artists Against Piracy in coalition with major record companies to combat the piracy occurring on Napster and other peer-to-peer internet services. In contrast, some established artists such as Neil Young saw piracy as the new radio and applauded the potential to reach larger audiences and drive additional sales through increased popularity. Seeing both the benefits and detriments of piracy, singer Norah Jones stated, If people hear it I'm happy...it's great that young people who don't have a lot of money can listen to music and be exposed to new things... But I also understand it's not ideal for the record industry, and a lot of young artists who won't make any [money] off their album sales, but at least they can tour.\nAlthough court rulings forced Napster to terminate its file-sharing business, Napster's innovations stimulated payment-based services, such as iTunes, Pandora, and many others. But the availability of such services has not put an end to the debate surrounding artist compensation with digital music, as seen with Taylor Swift's open letter to Apple in 2015. Swift's albums, along with the music of many other artists, were going to be streamed at no cost to new Apple Music customers over the first three months of service without any compensation to the\nartists. In her open letter, Swift stated, I'm not sure you know that Apple Music will not be paying writers, producers, or artists for those three months. I find it to be shocking, disappointing, and completely unlike this historically progressive and generous company. Within a few hours, Apple responded by changing the terms of its agreement in order to compensate artists at a reduced rate.",
      "questions": [
        "1.\tArtists generally agree that piracy causes financial harm, but some artists recognize that piracy creates exposure for the artist and access for the listener. Do you think the benefits of piracy outweigh the harms done? Why or why not?",
        "2.\tAlong with other file-sharing services, Napster helped to stimulate payment-based services such as iTunes, Pandora, and many others. Do you think this positive outcome justifies Napster's illegal activities? Why or why not?",

        "4.\tIn cases of piracy, it is difficult to conceptualize everyone affected. Which of the ten moral rules (identified by Bernard Gert) does piracy violate? Other than the artists, who else is potentially affected by piracy? Does a broader view of the people affected and harms caused change your opinion on piracy? Why or why not?"

      "content": "Dr. V's Magical Putter\nOn January 15, 2014, sports blog Grantland published the article Dr. V's Magical Putter, a longform piece by journalist Caleb Hannan. What began as an article about a unique new golf putter gradually became an article about the inventor of the putter, Dr. Essay Anne Vanderbilt. In his investigation into Vanderbilt's invention, Hannan discovered that Vanderbilt had lied about her academic background and work experience and had taken cash from an investor that she never returned.\nHannan also found out that Vanderbilt was a transgender woman and outed her as trans to an investor. Although Hannan had made an agreement with Vanderbilt to focus the story on the science, not the scientist, the putter became a backdrop to a story about what Hannan saw as a deceitful personal life and fraudulent professional career. Vanderbilt, who wished to maintain her privacy from the start, did not want the story published. A few months before Grantland published the article, Vanderbilt committed suicide.\n\nThe article sparked immediate controversy over the merits and ethics of its reporting, as well as its role in Vanderbilt's suicide. Detractors criticized Hannan and Grantland for a lack of awareness and compassion regarding trans issues. Defenders of the article saw value in the story and believed it would be dangerous to not report all of the facts. In an editorial response published in Grantland, sports journalist Christina Kahrl wrote, It was not Grantland's job to out [Vanderbilt], noting, she was a member of a community...for whom suicide attempts outpace the national average almost 26 times over. Josh Levin, executive editor at Slate, wrote, The fact that Dr. V once lived under a different name is not irrelevant to Hannan's story... But presenting Dr. V's gender identity as one in a series of lies and elisions was a careless editorial decision. ...Dr. V is a con artist and a trans woman.\nHannan, though, conflates those two facts... Journalist James Kirchick defended Hannan, writing, What I saw was a careful and ingenious reporter ferret out a fraud with care. ...[There's] no evidence that Hannan was...seeking to out and humiliate a transgender woman... On the contrary, in his article, Hannan arrives at a conclusion sympathetic to Vanderbilt. Trans advocate and medical doctor Dana Beyer said that the article reflected the tragedy of being in the closet as trans, but did not revel in it or have malicious intentions.\nSeveral days after the publication of the article, Grantland editor-in-chief Bill Simmons published a response to the article's criticism. He wrote, I didn't know nearly enough about the transgender community--and neither does my staff... We just\ndidn't see the other side. We weren't sophisticated enough. In the future, we will be sophisticated enough... we made mistakes, and we're going to learn from them. Reflecting on the article over a year later, Hannan spoke about the complexities of seeking truth in journalism, At every point in the reporting I could justify myself going forward... 'I'm doing my job.' But part of the job was to assess whether it was worth it.",

        "1.\tWhile Hannan and Grantland were certainly legally permitted to publish this article, do you think it was ethically permissible to do so? Why or why not?",
        "2.\tIf you were in Hannan's position when investigating Vanderbilt's educational and personal background, what would you have done and why?",
        "3.\tWhat biases and/or pressures do you think contributed to Hannan pursuing the story and outing Vanderbilt to an investor? How did he rationalize his actions? Explain.",
        "4.\tIf you were in Simmons' position before publishing the article, what would you have done and why? 5.\tWhat biases and/or pressures do you think contributed to Simmons publishing the article? How did he rationalize this decision? Explain. 6.\tDo you think comprehensive reporting and truth in journalism can be balanced effectively with respecting individuals' privacy? Why or why not? How can journalists, in Hannan's words, assess whether pursuing a story is worth it? 7.\tDo you think journalists bear a special responsibility to people who may be at risk of harm or face oppression based on their identity?

      "content": "East Germany's Doping Machine\nAfter defeating Hitler's Nazi Germany in World War II, the victorious Allies divided the country.\nEast Germany (or the German Democratic Republic--GDR) became part of the Eastern Bloc,\ndominated by the communist United Soviet Socialist Republic (USSR). West Germany had a\ncapitalist economy and became an ally of the U.S. and Western European nations. For many\nreasons, the GDR economy struggled mightily. So many of its citizens tried to defect to West\nGermany that the GDR had to build the Berlin Wall to imprison its people in the city of Berlin,\nwhich was located inside the GDR.\nBy the 1960s, the GDR government had decided that the small nation would make its mark in\nathletics. Achieving success in this realm would signal to the entire world the superiority of its\ncommunist system. A secret government law was enacted specifying that doping substances\nhad to be a key part of athletes' training. Coaches and doctors became part of an\ninstitutionalized system of doping designed to give GDR athletes a competitive advantage. The\ngovernment recruited athletes at a young age. They placed the most promising ones into a\nsystem of rigorous training and significant doping. Most often, athletes were given an anabolic\nsteroid--Oral-Turinabol--in the form of little blue and pink pills, which were handed out like\ncandy. Athletes were required to take the pills and forbidden from talking about them.\nThe doctors and coaches told the athletes that the pills were vitamins. It is likely that some of\nthe athletes, especially the youngest ones, believed this to be true...at least for a time. But the\nlarge majority came to know, as the coaches and doctors already did, that these were\nperformance enhancing drugs and had a major impact on the athletes' bodies. Male athletes\ngained muscle mass, enjoyed increased stamina, and recovered from exertion quicker. Female\nathletes experienced similar but even greater effects.\nFrom 1968 to the late 1980s, the GDR doped some 9,000 athletes, and gained many successes\nin international athletic competitions, particularly the Olympics. The GDR women's swim team\nin the 1968 Olympics enjoyed the most amazing (and suspicious) success. As usual, the U.S. had\na very strong team, but the muscular GDR women won eleven of thirteen gold medals in the\ncompetition. Indeed, one of the greatest upsets in Olympic swimming history came when the\nU.S. women's team won its only gold medal of the Montreal games. The U.S. team upset the\nheavily-favored East Germans in the 4x100-\nmeter relay with Jill Sterkel taking the lead for\nthe Americans in the third leg of the race and\nShirley Babashoff (who would have won\nmultiple golds absent GDR doping) sprinting\nhome for the win. The U.S. team shattered the\nworld record by four seconds.\nCase Study - East Germany's Doping Machine - Page 1 of 6\nAlthough most of the male and female GDR athletes knew that they were engaged in illegal\ndoping that gave them an unfair advantage. Many of them had strong misgivings about the\npractice, although they generally followed instructions from their coaches and doctors. One\nswimmer later said: The training motto at the pool was, 'You eat the pills, or you die.' It was\nforbidden to refuse.\nBut some did resist. One female swimmer, who gained 45 pounds of muscle, said:\nI just woke one day and said this feels like sh*t. It's wrong, it's cheating, and I feel\nhorrible. When I said no, no more pills, no more needles, the coaches freaked out. They\nkept trying to convince me to dope, but I refused. Shortly afterward, my performances\nfell behind my other training partners, so they moved me into the lazy group. I was no\nlonger a member of the GDR elite. There was fighting and arguing and it got ugly, so in\n1979, right before [the] Moscow [Olympics], I just quit. Hung up my suit.\nI knew we were on something. Everybody was getting enormous, and we are talking\nabout young women, teenagers, here; so we all knew that we were being doped, but we\nwere forbidden to talk to anyone or to each other. It was like prison. I got called before\nthe Central Committee, the big STASI [the GDR's secret police force] honchos; they\nwanted me to take the vitamins and keep swimming; but I told them forget it, it was\nwrong and dangerous. They thought I was nuts, so they cut me loose. I also believe that\nsome of the young girls loved the way their swim times dropped and their recovery from\nhard workouts, so they didn't complain; they rather enjoyed it.\nOlympic doping authorities finally caught up to the GDR practices in the late 1980s. Doctors and\ncoaches were intimately involved in the doping system, even though they knew of the\nunfortunate side effects that Oral-Turnibol had on the athletes. Men's penises shrank.\nWomen's clitorises grew. Women found hair growing in unusual amounts in unusual places.\nWomen's voices also dropped and they became more aggressive. Athletes of both genders\nsuffered terrible acne, liver damage, heart disease, and various cancers. Many women suffered\ninfertility, and many who were able to have children gave birth to babies with significant birth\ndefects. These adverse effects were known by the doctors and coaches. One doctor said (many\nyears later): I can only repeat my profound regret. I was far too obedient. We were pressured\ninto producing for the political leadership. We had to create international champions for the\nglory of the communist sporting machine.\nCase Study - East Germany's Doping Machine - Page 2 of 6",
      "questions": [
        "1. Because the anabolic steroids were detectable in the body for a period of time after ingestion, the GDR doctors substituted testosterone injections for the steroid pills just before meets when the athletes would be tested. One 15-year-old female swimmer initially refused the injections before a relay, but was pressured by her coach and gave in. Do you think it would be more difficult for a younger athlete to resist a coach's unethical orders than an older athlete? If so, why?",
        "2. At the 3:30 mark in the Ethics Unwrapped video on Bounded Ethicality (https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/video/bounded-ethicality), a student discusses a situation where a soccer coach might unethically encourage players to be especially rough with their opponents. Would you resist such an instruction? a. Would you find it more difficult to say 'no' if you were a marginal player fighting for playing time than if you were a star on the team? Explain.",
        "3. A GDR triple jumper resisted doping, but his coach pressured him, telling him that he needed the drugs to be competitive and so he had to take them. Then, the triple jumper felt justified in doping because his coach had coerced him. In other words, this was not a case where he trusted the coach and assumed that what the coach said to do was a proper thing to do. Rather, he knew that it was wrong to follow the coach's instructions, but he could tell himself that he didn't really have any choice. Is this still a manifestation of the obedience to authority phenomenon? Why or why not?",
        "4. One GDR athlete noted: We had no choice because we were under a dictatorship. Does it make sense to you that it might be more difficult to resist the unethical instructions of a superior in a dictatorship than in a tightly-run corporation? Why or why not? a. Given that there were more than 3,000 STASI moles within the sport system who informed the state of what athletes said and did, does this change your thinking? If so, how?",
        "5. Sports doctors and coaches knew about the adverse effects that the steroids they gave would have upon athletes' long-term health, but they did it anyway. The doctors signed confidentiality agreements promising to keep the side-effects secret. The agreements were monitored by the STASI. Given that the STASI were among the most feared secret police in history, is it understandable that the doctors and coaches might have followed instructions? Explain your reasoning. Case Study - East Germany's Doping Machine - Page 3 of 6 a. How do you think the doctors and coaches justified their actions to themselves? What about to others? Discuss. 6. One of the big frauds of the Enron era involved HealthSouth, a huge company that manipulated financial statements to hide its shaky status. Five different CFOs testified that CEO Richard Scrushy managed greatly by fear and intimidation, leading them to feel afraid to blow the whistle or even to leave the company. When one CFO threatened to quit, Scrushy told him that he couldn't because Scrushy would make him the fall guy. Do you see parallels with the way the GDR ran its doping program? Explain. 7. Some athletes, like the one who gained 45 pounds of muscle, managed to stand up to the authorities and say 'no.' What enabled these athletes to succeed in resisting authority? Do you have any theories? 8. In the GDR, successful athletes led relatively privileged lives as compared to the common citizen. They received better housing, access to cars, improved job prospects, and the ability to travel abroad. To refuse to participate in the doping program meant that, in all likelihood, the athlete would be removed from the program. That would mean being deprived of the benefits that went with sports stardom - for the athlete and for their family. Is it possible that the self-serving bias was one of the reasons that athletes tended to be obedient to authority...to follow instructions to cheat? Explain. 9. Critics have argued that the doctors and coaches went along with the doping scheme to earn money, be important, to be someone. Is it possible that the self-serving biased reinforced these doctors' and coaches' natural tendency to be obedience to authority? Explain. 10. One of the GDR sports doctors said: I have friends who tell me that if I had not injected these teenage swimmers...someone else would have stepped in and replaced me. Of course, that was the same excuse used during the Third Reich that if we didn't respond to Hitler, another doctor would have fulfilled the function. I should have shown more courage. In Nazi Germany we all did what we were told to do. The GDR doping machine was no different; we were just carrying out our medical orders, never questioning the system that was good to us, just doing our jobs. Have we not learned anything? What do you think of this observation? 11. Around 2017, it became clear that for 40 years Russia has continued to run a doping system similar to the GDR's. Russian runner Yuliya Stepanova, who became a whistleblower, told reporters that she had been committed to doing everything her coaches asked of her: I train like they say, I take drugs like they say. Does this sound like obedience to authority? Explain. Case Study - East Germany's Doping Machine - Page 4 of 6 a. This situation sounds very similar to the GDR program that was busted in the 1980s. Do you agree? Why or why not? b. Why do you think this pattern of cheating continues to live on in professional sports? c. What other behavioral ethics factors might play a role?

      "content": "Ethical Pitfalls in Action\nIf you are like most people, you want to be a good person, and you want others to think of you as a\ngood person. You also think of yourself as a good person. But (again), if you are like most people, you\ncan think of moral mistakes you have made. Maybe you wish you could have a do-over regarding\nsome (or many) of these ethical missteps. Why is it that you - an essentially good person - have made\nthese moral errors? Why is it that all of us make these moral missteps and stumble into doing unethical\nthings?\nWell, a big emphasis of behavioral ethics is on this simple question: Why do good people do bad\nthings? Behavioral ethics is the science of moral decision-making, which explores why and how people\nmake the ethical (and unethical) decisions that they do. The videos in this series address this\nfundamental question by focusing on some of the influences that can adversely affect our moral\ndecision-making. This is far from an exhaustive list; there are a great many pressures and influences\nthat affect our thinking, choices, and actions in the moral realm.\nThese videos examine:\n Obedience to authority: the tendency we have to wish to please those in charge, like managers\nand coaches.\n The conformity bias: the tendency we have to take our cues for proper behavior in most social\ncontexts from the actions of others, such as friends and teammates.\n The self-serving bias: the tendency we have to gather information, process information, and\neven remember information in a manner that advances our self-interest.\n The overconfidence bias: the tendency we often have to be overconfident regarding our own\nabilities, including in the area of moral decision-making.\n Framing: the tendency we have to be overly influenced by things that are in our frame of\nreference when we make moral decisions, but insufficiently influenced by factors that we have\nomitted (maybe unintentionally) from our frame of reference.\n Incrementalism: the slippery slope--the frequent failure we have to notice that ethical\nstandards are being eroded a little bit at a time.\n Role Morality: the tendency we have to use different ethical standards as we play different\nroles in life and society.\n Loss Aversion: the tendency we have to prefer\navoiding losses to gaining rewards.\n Tangible & Abstract: the tendency we have to\nbe impacted more by vivid, tangible, and\ncontemporaneous factors than by factors that\nare removed from us in time and space.\nCase Study - Ethical Pitfalls in Action - Page 1 of 5",
      "questions": [
        "1. Sometimes athletes face various temptations to do wrong. They may consider using performance-enhancing drugs in order to, well, enhance their performance. Or, they might tamper with their equipment. For example, as baseball players have sometimes used corked bats and NASCAR drivers have used oversized carburetors to get more power. Do you think that athletes would be more likely to fudge the rules if their coaches ordered them to do so? Explain your reasoning. Assume that your baseball coach told you to use an illegal bat. Or your soccer coach told you to play aggressively in a way that might injure a player on the opposing team who was wearing a knee brace. Would you be more likely to cross a line if your coach urged you to do it? Why or why not? If the answer is yes, then that is obedience to authority in action.",
        "2. Studies show that people are more likely to litter in an area where others have obviously littered. As you drive down the highway, are you more likely to speed if other drivers around you are speeding? Why or why not? Assume that (at the end of practice) your coach always orders the team to run 10 laps. Then the coach heads home. The other players get in the habit of running just eight laps and calling it done, since no one is monitoring them. Are you more likely to cut your laps short because your teammates are doing so? Explain. If so, that's the conformity bias in action. a. What if the others on the team were running all ten laps?",
        "3. We have all evolved to generally look out for our own best interests. That's how we survive to reproduce and pass on our DNA. Assume that you are competing in a hotly-contested game and a referee has to make a call on a close play: Did the batter check her swing in time? Was the wide receiver juggling the ball as he went out of bounds? Did the center block the shot before it hit the backboard or afterward (which would be goal-tending)? When this happened, were you more likely to think the referee got it right if the call went for your team than if it went against your team? Explain. a. Were you more likely to protest if the close call went against your team? Why or why not? If so, this is the self-serving bias in action.",
        "4. March Madness is exciting each year, in part because college basketball fans are curious to see which top seeds will fall by the wayside early in the tournament. Almost every year, a #3 seed gets knocked off by a #14 seed. Twice, #1 seeds have lost their first game to #16 seeds. Assume that you see such an upset on television. Might you wonder whether the higher seed had taken the opponent lightly, suffering from overconfidence in their ability? Explain your reasoning. Case Study - Ethical Pitfalls in Action - Page 2 of 5 a. Might you see echoes of such overconfidence if you compared your view of yourself as a good person with past ethical missteps you know you have committed? Why or why not? If so, this is the overconfidence bias in action.",
        "5. Old-time Major League Baseball manager Leo Durocher was a fiery competitor, known for statements such as:  Nice guys finish last.  I believe in rules. Sure I do. If there weren't any rules, how could you break them?  Win any way you can as long as you can get away with it.  If I was playing third base and my mother rounded third with the wining run, I'd trip her up. Clearly, Durocher focused on winning to the exclusion of pretty much every other consideration. Assume that in the bottom of the ninth inning of a baseball or softball game, which will decide the league championship, you are playing third base. An opposing player (not your mother) rounds third with the potential winning run. You notice that all eyes - including the umpires' - appear to be on the right fielder who has scooped up the ball and is preparing to throw to home plate. Caught up in the moment, you trip the runner, preventing the score. Will you later regret that action? Why or why not? a. Will you regret it if it was caught on camera? Explain. b. Did you make a spur-of-the-moment decision because winning was the only thing in your frame of reference at the time, crowding out any ethical concerns? If so, framing may have played a role.",
        "6. Incrementalism is the slippery slope. Sometimes people cut a small ethical corner and nothing bad happens. Continuing to cut the corner can become the new normal and next thing you know, they cut a slightly bigger corner and so on. Assume that you play minor league ball for a team that doesn't pay much, as is typical for minor league ball. But the team reimburses you for the money you spend on meals. Given your low salary, this money comes in very handy. One day a couple of your teammates mention that because the team doesn't require them to show receipts, they add $2 to every meal for which they claim reimbursement. You think if they're doing it (and haven't been caught), this can't be too bad. After all, they seem like nice people. You start doing the same thing. Then, a little while later, you change the $2 bump to $4. You recently moved into the starting lineup, so you are even more underpaid than before. After a bit, you move the $4 to $5 (it's just one dollar more) because inflation has been so severe lately. And on it goes. a. Can you see yourself doing this? Why or why not? b. If not, can you at least imagine some other player doing it? Explain. If so, that's incrementalism in action. Case Study - Ethical Pitfalls in Action - Page 3 of 5",
        "7. Role morality is the idea that sometimes people fail to live up to their own ethical standards because they feel that they are playing a certain role that excuses them from those standards. They might normally have personal principles against killing another human being, but because they've enlisted in the military it now seems okay to kill enemy soldiers. Assume that you play for an NFL team (Team A) and have really given it your all (as your parents taught you to do). However, despite all your hard work, things have not worked out for various reasons. Team A has traded you to Team B. You also intend to throw your heart and soul into helping Team B win. As it happens, due to a paperwork mistake, you have two copies of Team A's playbook. After the trade, Team A asks you to return your playbook, and you do. But you still possess the other playbook. You mention this in passing to your new coach at Team B, who says: Fantastic! We'll need to see that playbook ASAP! In your new role as a loyal player for Team B, will you be tempted to hand over the playbook? Why or why not? a. Up to now, as a loyal player for Team A, you have kept the playbook confidential. How has the trade to Team B affected your decision? Explain. If you are tempted, that is role morality in action.",
        "8. Loss aversion exists because people tend to hate losses more than they enjoy gains. Therefore, they will take risks, sometimes including taking illegal actions, to avoid losses that they would never take in order to secure the gains in the first place. Assume you are a high school tennis player in a state where players make the calls as to whether the opponent's ball has hit inside the line or outside. The schools cannot afford to pay umpires to make such calls. You are very good. Indeed, you have won every match your freshman, sophomore, and your junior years. As a senior, you are undefeated and are in the state championship singles round. One more win, and you will be the only player in your state's history to be undefeated for four consecutive years. Your town's newspaper has sent a reporter to the match to write an article about you, if you win. Rumor is that you might be a Face in the Crowd in the next issue of Sports Illustrated. Might this situation change how you look at this next match from a gain frame (I want to win, like always!) to a loss frame (OMG, if I lose then my perfect record is down the drain, the newspaper story goes away, and I can kiss my appearance in SI goodbye!)? Explain your reasoning. a. If you look at this from a loss frame, might that way of looking at the match increase the temptation for you to miscall an opponent's shot at a crucial point in the match? Why or why not? If this happens, it's loss aversion in action.",
        "9. People are typically influenced more by factors that are close in time and geography than by factors that are more distant from them in time and space. This is often called the bias of the tangible and the abstract. It means we are often more concerned with the impact our actions will have right now on others nearby than we are about the impact our actions will have on others sometime in the future or on those who are far away geographically. Case Study - Ethical Pitfalls in Action - Page 4 of 5 Assume that after a successful professional baseball or fastpitch career, you became a coach in the major leagues and are now a manager. As part of a package deal to acquire a needed starting pitcher, your general manager has also acquired a utility infielder. Your team is now one player over the roster limit. As manager, you need to cut someone and ship that person to the minor leagues. The new infielder, whom you do not know and have never met, has nearly identical statistics (batting average, fielding average, home runs hit, etc.) as your current utility infielder. You like your current infielder, who has compiled a reasonable record in four years on your team's roster, though has never starred. Will you find it easier to cut the new infielder? Explain. If the answer is yes, that could be the tangible & the abstract at work. Author: Robert Prentice, J.D.

      "content": "Case Study - Ethical Use of Home DNA Testing - Page 1 of 4 \nEthical Use of Home DNA Testing \n \nHome DNA testing is a booming business. Millions of Americans have sent their DNA to commercial \ntesting companies such as 23andMe or Ancestry to learn more about their heritage or potential for \ndisease. According to Grand View Research, the global DNA testing market is set to reach over $10 \nbillion by 2022. (Brown 2018). Successful marketing campaigns have led consumers to believe that \nhome DNA testing is fun, informative, and personal to them. However, what consumers may not \nrealize is that once their genetic information is shared, they have limited control as to who has access \nto it. \n \nRegardless of the reason consumers decide to purchase a home DNA test kit, the information they \nprovide to the testing company is far greater than the information they receive.  The benefits that \nthese testing companies can gain from gathering, using, and selling customers' private information \nplaces them in a significant conflict-of-interest situation.  Some of this information includes the IP \naddress, name, address, email, and family history, collected from the application, as well as \ninformation provided on follow up surveys. Furthermore, according to its website, if customers opt to \nshare their data for research, 23andMe could keep their physical spit sample and the genetic data it \ncontains for up to a decade. Additional information that consumers upload to the companies' \ngenealogy website, such as pictures, obituaries, family relationships, and even third-party information \nis probably added to the pool of data linked to customers' DNA. \n \nRecently, some have felt that privacy and consumer rights have been violated when they used home \nDNA kits. In June 2019, Lori Collett sued Ancestry for allegedly misleading customers about what it was \ndoing with their DNA. This class action lawsuit claims that personal information was released to outside \nparties without customer consent. Further contentions include that the waiver of consumer rights \nthrough consent forms is often vague, general in scope, and ever-changing. The fine print may not \naccurately spell out what the company, its third-party associates, and collaborators can or will do with \ncustomer information. (Merken, 2019) \n \nFurther concerns arise as testing companies often align themselves with pharmaceutical companies, \npublic and private research organizations, and Google. For example, GlaxoSmithKline purchased a \n$300 million stake in the company, allowing the pharmaceutical giant to use 23andMe's trove of \ngenetic data to develop new drugs -- and raising new privacy concerns for consumers. (Ducharme, \n2018)  Similarly, Ancestry is sharing its data with Google through its research subsidiary Calico. \nAncestry admits that once they share people's genetic information with partner companies, they can't \nbe responsible for security protocols of those partners. \n(Leavenworth, 2018).  \n \nAdditionally, both 23andMe and Ancestry use Google \nAnalytics to provide third parties with consumer information \nfor targeted marketing. In its privacy policy 23andMe states \nthat when you use our Services, including our website or \nmobile app(s), our third-party service providers may collect \n\n \nCase Study - Ethical Use of Home DNA Testing - Page 2 of 4 \nWeb-Behavior Information about your visit, such as the links you clicked on, the duration of your visit, \nand the URLs you visited. This use of shared information allows testing services and third parties to \nbuild a comprehensive personal profile on you, which may include your genetic information. \n \nAlthough privacy may be a concern of consumers, law enforcement with the cooperation of DNA \ntesting companies, either through partnership or warrants, have brought justice to the victims of \nnumerous unsolved cases. Over the past few years the use of consumer DNA databases have closed \nmany high profile cold cases such as the Golden State Killer and overturned the wrongful conviction of \nAlfred Swinton. In some cases, such as the Golden State Killer, the DNA used to identify suspects are \ncross referenced through the DNA of relatives as far removed as third cousins. However, this has \nbrought additional concerns, as a DNA expert for the American Civil Liberties Union, Vera Eidelman \nstates, There's always a danger that things will be used beyond their initial targets, beyond their initial \npurpose. (St. John 2019) \n \nThe success of consumer DNA databases has led some law enforcement to meet with Bennett \nGreenspan, the CEO of FamilyTreeDNA, seeking his help to convince consumers to share their genetic \ndata with police.  This partnership has resulted in the creation of the non-profit Institute for DNA \nJustice that has the following stated mission:  \n \nThe Institute for DNA Justice was formed to educate the public about the value of investigative \ngenetic genealogy (IGG) as a revolutionary new tool to identify, arrest, and convict violent \ncriminals, deter violent crime, exonerate the innocent, encourage the 26 million Americans who \nhave taken a DNA test to become genetic witnesses by participating in publicly available family-\nmatching databases working with law enforcement using IGG, and to promote the adoption of \nindustry leading best practices guidelines surrounding its use by law enforcement agencies \naround the country. \n \nRegardless of public or private testing, laws in the United States have not yet determined a standard \nfor the home DNA testing industry.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nCase Study - Ethical Use of Home DNA Testing - Page 3 of 4 \nResources:\n \nAmy Brown, DNA Testing is Popular, But Many Are Unaware of Privacy Concerns, TriplePundit, Dec. \n18, 2018. https://www.triplepundit.com/story/2018/dna-testing-popular-many-are-unaware-privacy-\nconcerns/55936 \n \nJamie Ducharme, A Major Drug Company Now Has Access to 23andMe's Genetic Data.

      "title": "Freedom-of-Speech-on-Campus",
      "content": "Freedom of Speech on Campus\nIn the fall of 2015, student groups on the campuses of the University of Missouri and Yale University led protests in the wake of a series of racially-motivated offenses that many students saw as part of a history of unsafe or hostile campus climates for students of color, particularly black students. Offenses included verbal, emotional, and physical abuse.\nAt Yale University, administrators sent an email to students that offered advice on racially-insensitive costumes to avoid for Halloween, including costumes featuring blackface or mock Native American headdresses. Controversy emerged after Erika Christakis, a white lecturer of early childhood education and associate master at one of the university's residential colleges, sent an email to the students she resided over in which she objected to the call for sensitivity. Christakis debated what she described as an institutional... exercise of implied control over college students, asking, Is there no room anymore for a child or young person to be a little bit obnoxious... a little bit inappropriate or provocative or, yes, offensive? In response, many students signed an open letter to Christakis. In this letter they stated, We are not asking to be coddled... [We] simply ask that our existences not be invalidated on campus. This is us asking for basic respect of our cultures and our livelihoods. During a protest, a student confronted Christakis's husband, Nicholas Christakis, a professor at Yale and master of one of the residential colleges. In disagreement, the students told him to step down, saying that being a master was not about creating an intellectual space... [but] creating a home here.\n\nAt Missouri, university administrators were criticized for their slow and ineffective responses to address ongoing racial tensions on the campus. After Payton Head, a black student and president of the Missouri Student Association, was taunted with racial slurs, it took university chancellor R. Bowen Loftin nearly a week to respond. Following this and other incidences, students organized rallies and demonstrations. Tensions were made worse after someone used feces to smear a swastika on a communal bathroom in a residence hall. This act of vandalism, and the university's response, became the final straw for graduate student Jonathan Butler. Butler had led or been involved in many demonstrations up to this point. He decided to go on indefinite hunger strike until university system president, Tim Wolfe, was removed from office. In support of Butler, the football team later announced they would neither practice nor play until Wolfe resigned. Many students joined in support of the protests. Butler ended his weeklong hunger strike after Wolfe resigned.\nIn the midst of the student protests at Missouri, further controversy emerged when protesters tried to keep news media out of the campus public grounds where\nprotesters had been camping out for days. Student photographer Tim Tai, on assignment for ESPN, was surrounded and confronted by protesters, including university staff members, who did not want any media to enter what they said was a safe space. Tai was attempting to document the protests in public spaces, stating, This is the First Amendment that protects your right to stand here and mine. ...The law protects both of us. A video capturing\n \nthe confrontation went viral and sparked wider debate over the issue of freedom of speech in the protests at Missouri, Yale, and other college campuses. Journalists, commentators, and academics raised discussion over the roles of free speech, deliberation, and tolerance in the dialogue between student activists and university administrators.\nFreelance journalist Terrell Jermaine Starr, in defense of the protesters, wrote: This wasn't a problem with Tai's character or his journalistic integrity; he was doing his job... but reporters should also feel a responsibility to try to understand and respect [the protesters'] pain... Starr continued: In many communities that historically have been marginalized and unfairly portrayed by the media, there's good reason people do not trust journalists: They often criminalize black people's pain and resistance to racial oppression. Suzanne Nossel, executive director of PEN American Center, defended free speech as a crucial driver of social justice reform: [Without] free speech, the safe spaces students crave will soon suffocate them. Social movements must evolve or they die. Ideological and even tactical evolution demands willingness to hear out heterodoxy. Likewise, free speech defenders will not win by dismissing students as insolent whiners. ...The Black Lives Matter movement and the campus protests are efforts to jump-start a drive for racial equality that has stalled in key areas. Free speech is essential to that quest.\n\nWriting about the Yale incident, journalist Conor Friedersdorf suggested that the student activists' intolerance of other views could lead to censorship. He wrote, [Students] were perfectly free to talk about their pain. Some felt entitled to something more, and that is what prolonged the debate. Op-ed columnist Nicholas Kristof addressed the broader role of freedom of speech on college campuses: The protesters at Mizzou and Yale and elsewhere make a legitimate point: Universities should work harder to make all students feel they are safe and belong. Members of minorities--whether black or transgender or (on many campuses) evangelical conservatives--should be able to feel a part of campus, not feel mocked in their own community. Political theorist Danielle Allen, on the other hand, described the debate over freedom of speech as a distraction from the key issues of the protests. Allen wrote, The issues of free speech matter, too, but they are leading people in the wrong direction, away from the deepest issue. ...The real issue is how to think about social equality.",

      "title": "Head Injuries & American Football",
      "content": "Head Injuries & American Football\nAmerican football is a rough and dangerous game. Football is both notorious and cherished for its unapologetic, brute-force violence.1 Players suffer bruises, lacerations, torn muscles, dislocated shoulders, torn knee ligaments, broken bones, internal organ damage, and, occasionally, even paralysis. Football rules intentionally create high speed collisions between human beings, making such injuries inevitable and the sport controversial. And new knowledge about brain injuries have caused many people to call football immoral2 and to advocate its abolition.3\nA traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a disruption in the normal function of the brain that can be caused by a bump, blow, or jolt to the head, or penetrating head injury.4 A concussion is a form of TBI where the blow causes the brain to move rapidly back and forth, bouncing around in the skull and suffering various types of structural damage. 5 Although concussions can carry serious consequences, they are termed a mild form of TBI because they are not typically life threatening. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is brain degeneration likely caused by repeated head traumas.6 Repetitive head impacts (RHIs) can cumulatively lead to CTE and early death, even though no single RHI results in a concussion.7\nIf only one thing is clear about the current science surrounding sports-related concussions (SRCs) and related brain injuries, it is that very little is clear about the current science. The field is surprisingly new. As told in the movies, a significant scientific breakthrough occurred in 2002 when an African-American neuropathologist in Pittsburgh named Bennet Omalu (played by Will Smith in the 2015 movie Concussion) performed an autopsy on Hall of Fame center Mike Webster. Dr. Omalu identified abnormal clumps of the protein tau in Webster's brain, which he believed to be evidence of CTE.8 Such proteins\ndevelop in tangles that slowly strangle neurons and, consequently, inhibit brain function.9\nMany recent studies point to how dangerous football is to players' long-term brain health. These studies are broken down by football league level:\nNational Football League (NFL):\n\tOver two regular seasons (2012-2014), NFL players sustained 4,384 injuries, including 301 concussions. This statistic is up 61% from 2002-2007, perhaps reflecting an improvement of awareness and reporting.10\n\tIn a study of 14,000 NFL players, researchers found that even head impacts insufficient to cause concussions can mount up over the years, leading to CTE and premature death.\n \nAn NFL player who plays 24 games increases the likelihood of premature death by 16%.11\n\tA 2019 study of the brains of 223 football players with CTE and 43 players without CTE found that for each additional 2.6 years of play, the risk of developing CTE doubled.12\n\tAnother study found that greater RHI exposure correlated with higher levels of plasma t-tau (a biomarker for CTE) in symptomatic former NFL players as compared to the study's control group.13\n\tOf 111 NFL players whose brains were donated for one study, 110 were diagnosed with CTE.14\n\tA 2012 study of 3,439 NFL players with five years or more in the NFL found that their neurogenerative mortality was three times that of the general U.S. population, and four times higher for two subcategories: Alzheimer's disease, and Lou Gehrig's Disease (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS).15\n\tOther studies found that NFL players who suffered concussions were more likely to later be diagnosed with depression, 16 dementia-related syndromes,17 Lou Gehrig's Disease (ALS),18 and erectile dysfunction.19\nCollege & High School:\n\tA study of former high school and college football players found that RHI exposure predicted later-life apathy, depression, executive dysfunction, and cognitive impairment.20\n\tAfter a single season, college football players had less midbrain white matter than they had started with.21\n\tHigh school athletes are reluctant to report concussions.22\n\tA 2017 study found CTE in 21% of donated brains of deceased high school football players.23\n\tOver time more evidence has indicated that even mild concussions suffered by high school football players can cause serious consequences.24\n\tFootball causes more concussions than any other high school sport,25 and these concussions can cause death.26\nYouth Leagues (Under 14):\n\tYouth football players average 240 head impacts per season. Some of these are high impacts comparable to those experienced in high school and college games.27\n\tChildren between the ages of 9 and 14 make up the largest cohort of football players in the U.S. They can suffer concussions from milder collisions than would be required to concuss a collegiate or professional player.28\n\tAccording to research by neuroscientists, There seems to be greater consequences if you're getting your head hit when the brain is rapidly developing [below age 12].29\n \n\tA study of former NFL players found that those who began playing football before age 12 tended to show greater later-life cognitive impairments as compared to those who began after age 12.30\n\nTHE OTHER SIDE OF THE STORY\n\nGiven the results of the studies above, it is not surprising that there has been a strong outcry against football. However, the science in this area is truly not settled. Part of the reason is that [m]ost of the time when a player has a concussion, standard medical imaging techniques do not show damage.31 No gold standard for diagnosing concussions currently exists.32 Many researchers in the area recently published an article saying:\nContrary to common perception, the clinical syndrome of CTE has not yet been fully defined. Its prevalence is unknown, and the neuropathological diagnostic criteria are no more than preliminary. We have an incomplete understanding of the extent or distribution of pathology required to produce neurological dysfunction or to distinguish diseased from healthy tissue, with the neuropathological changes reported in apparently asymptomatic individuals.33\nNeuropsychologist Munro Cullum argues: I worry the pendulum has swung too far. The reality is that we still don't know who is most likely to suffer a concussion, who will take longer to recover, how anatomic or genetic differences influence concussions, and who may be at risk of prolonged symptoms or developing cognitive problems later in life.34\nFurthermore, many of the studies cited by those who would like to abolish tackle football have involved relatively small sample sizes.35 Other studies have involved skewed samples, including one where all the NFL players' brains had been donated because of mental declines that the donors had suffered before their deaths.36\nMost importantly, other studies seem to indicate that concussions may be more benign. Again, these studies are broken down by league level:\nNFL\n\tA 2016 study found no elevated risk of suicide in a population of players with at least five years in the league.37\n\tAnother study of 35 former NFL players over age 50 who had sustained multiple concussions during their careers found no significant association between the length of careers, the number of concussions, and their level of cognitive function later in life.38\n\tOne study found no statistically significant difference between the all-cause mortality among career NFL players and NFL replacement players who played just three games during the strike of 1987.39\n \n\tA 2007 study found that retired NFL players experienced levels of depressive symptoms no worse than those of the general population.40\nCollege & High School\n\tSuicide rates among NCAA football players are the highest among all sports, but they are substantially lower than the general population age 18-22 or college students in that age range.41\n\tA study of 3,904 Wisconsin men found no significant harmful association between playing football in high school and cognitive impairment or depression later in life.42\n\tReducing tackling in practices has reduced overall concussion numbers among high school players, even though the number of concussions in games has risen slightly. And concussion recurrence has been reduced, most likely by protocols guiding when it is safe to return to play.43\n\tOne expert said It really seems right now that if your [football] practices are highly controlled and reduced as much as possible and you only play four years of high school, your [CTE] risk is probably pretty low.44\nYouth Leagues (Under 14)\n\tDespite their heightened susceptibility to concussions, youth football players rarely sustain concussions because they are lighter and collide with less force than older players.45\n\tIn one study, use of newly-designed football helmets and safe tackling techniques eliminated concussions for 20 middle school aged players for an entire season.46\nStudies such as these provide ammunition for those who defend organized football as an institution. However, many such studies were funded or carried out by the NFL, owners of NFL franchises, universities that earn millions of dollars from football, and other interested parties. Given the obvious conflict of interest, the studies have been criticized on that ground.47 There is also evidence that the NFL sought to influence the findings of some of the research it funded. 48 In addition, evidence indicates (and is consistent with the self-serving bias) that industry funding of research often influences results.49\nThe NFL has taken other concrete steps to respond to the controversy. It paid more than $750 million to settle a civil lawsuit by former players.50 The NFL has also changed rules to discourage helmet-to-helmet contact,51 and has instituted protocols for safely returning concussed players to the field.52\nOn the other hand, while football helmets can prevent fractured skulls, they will likely never be able to prevent concussions.53 Studies indicate that there are helmets that may decrease concussions,54 but neuroscientist Julie Stamm says: No helmet will ever be concussion-proof, because the brain still moves inside the skull. And for the same reason, a helmet alone will not prevent CTE.55 Furthermore, while the NFL has banned helmet-to-helmet hits, these are\n \nneither the only nor the most common cause of concussions.56 Professor Goldberg argues that there is little evidence that such incremental changes [e.g., in tackling techniques] have a substantial risk-reducing effect.57\nSome people accuse the media (and others) of hysterically overhyping the dangers of tackle football to the brain.58 Other people believe that media discussions have impeded needed change in minimizing sports violence.59 At the end of the day, the jury still seems to be out on the question of whether you can go to a football game or watch one on television and still feel good about yourself for supporting a sport that seems to cause irreversible traumatic brain injuries.\n\n\nGeneral Discussion Questions\n\n1.\tWhich approach do you think should be used to determine the ethicality of banning, or at least seriously reforming, football to reduce head trauma? Utilitarian? Deontological? Explain why and how using that approach might play out.\n2.\tIf you apply Systematic Moral Analysis to the question of whether or not it is moral to continue to support and/or play football, do you get different results for different league categories and age groups? Explain. Is there a case to be made for justified harm in any of these leagues? Why or why not?\n3.\tNew Yorker writer Ingfei Chen observed that Fisher-Price had been required to recall a collapsible crib that was associated with 32 infant deaths. Five million cribs had been sold. Chen noted that there is no such thing as an acceptably risky crib, but contrasted it with sports like football where hazards are part of their attraction. She asked: How much risk is too much?\na.\tHow do we answer that question? What factors go into each side of the equation?\nb.\tAre the answers different for NFL players, college players, high school players, and under-14 players? Discuss your reasoning.\nc.\tIs this an ethical issue? A policy issue? A political issue? All three? Explain.\n4.\tChen also points to the uncertainties of the science, noting: For now, these complexities make certain questions about the disease unanswerable. If subconcussive blows are the cause of C.T.E., how much impact is too much? How do the tau clumps relate to the clinical syndrome--do the lesions fully explain the mood and memory problems? (Probably not; other kinds of brain abnormalities, such as inflammation or damage to neural wiring from head injuries, may play a role.)60 Chen further notes that the type of decades-long study that might resolve these issues would be terribly expensive and that no such study is on the horizon.61 In light of this continuing uncertainty, how do we decide whether (and how) to\n \nreform or even abolish football when we have lives on one side of the scales and livelihoods on the other?\na.\tDo these choices remind you of the COVID-19 pandemic when governments, in deciding whether to shut down society and later when to reopen it, had to weigh lives vs. livelihoods? Why or why not?\n5.\tThe NFL and universities, among others, urge no rash actions until there is more concrete proof of a causal link between concussions and adverse health outcomes. Others suggest that the uncertainty favors taking actions now rather than waiting until too much damage is done, as happened with tobacco.62 Sports sociologist Matt Ventresca argues: As sports executives and researchers issue precautionary calls for more conclusive evidence, countless athletes are exposed to repeated head impacts without the benefits of future knowledge gained from pending scientific investigations.63 Professor Daniel Goldberg claims that the Precautionary Principle64 demands that we prevent youngsters from playing football even if the evidence that it will cause serious damage to their brains is not yet clearly established:65 [W]aiting for robust evidence of causality is historically a very poor guideline for maximizing population health.66 Other public health experts similarly argue that the evidence of risk is sufficiently high to meet both parts of OSHA's test for significant risk of material impairment of health that justifies government intervention.67 In the face of medical uncertainty, what is the proper approach to this debate?\na.\tWhere should the burden of proof lie?\nb.\tWhich approach do you find more persuasive, and why?\nc.\tDo you think this an ethical issue or just a policy issue? Explain.\n6.\tRegarding sports concussions, President Obama stated: We have to change a culture that says 'you suck it up and play through a brain injury.... [Reporting a concussion] doesn't make you weak, it means you're strong. On the other hand, President Trump has stated that rule changes to diminish head injuries are ruining the game.68 Are politics, as well as ethics, involved in this debate? Discuss your reasoning.\n7.\tOne scientist said: Don't forget there's risk in everything we do. Riding a bicycle carries risk and not a whole lot of parents are not letting their kids ride a bike. So, we just need to kind of put it in context.69 Do you find this argument persuasive? Why or why not?\na.\tIs your opinion altered by the fact that the scientist quoted above is the neurologist for the Michigan State University football team?\n8.\tSome argue against paternalism and in favor of individual choice, believing that adults (at least) should be able to choose to engage in boxing (and presumably to play football) despite its potentially adverse consequences for brain health.70 Using John Stuart Mill's Harm Principle,71 others argue that the individualists overlook the damage that such a choice by a football player might have on others. For example, on the people the player might later beat up in a rage caused by brain deterioration, on the burden on caregivers of caring for a dementia-ridden patient, or the sorrow a premature death might cause\n \nrelatives, and the burden on society caused by high medical expenses to take care of an impaired ex-player.72 Where do you stand on the paternalism vs. individual choice debate?

Russell states: Dangerous sport in its best exemplars, particularly those in which substantial bodily danger is an immediate and ever-present risk, represents an opportunity for confronting and pressing beyond certain apparent limits of personal, and indeed human, physical and psychological capacities in ways not afforded by other normally available human activities.91 On the other hand, Philosopher Patrick Findler argues that children may not be able to fully realize the dangers they face when playing football, and that other, less dangerous activities, can provide the benefits Russell desires.92 Whose argument do you find more persuasive, and why?",

      "content": "Case Study - Head Injuries & The NFL - Page 1 of 6 \n \nHead Injuries & The NFL \nAmerican football is a rough and dangerous game. It features high-speed collisions between \nhuman beings at least one of whom is often very large. Broken bones, torn ligaments, and even \noccasional paralysis can result. But it is the research on brain injuries that has caused many \npeople to claim football is immoral and to advocate that it be banned. Such calls have gained \nthe attention and opposition of the National Football League (NFL) given the high popularity \nand profitability of football as a spectator sport.  \nThe Center for Disease Control defines a traumatic brain injury (TBI) as a disruption in the \nnormal function of the brain that can be caused by a bump, blow, or jolt to the head, or \npenetrating head injury. A concussion is a form of TBI where the blow causes the brain to \nmove rapidly back and forth, bouncing around in the skull and suffering various types of \nstructural damage.  Although concussions can carry serious consequences, they are termed a \nmild form of TBI because they are not typically life threatening. Chronic traumatic \nencephalopathy (CTE), says the Mayo Clinic, is brain degeneration likely caused by repeated \nhead traumas. Repetitive head impacts (RHIs) can cumulatively lead to CTE and early death, \neven though no single RHI results in a concussion.  \nIf only one thing is clear about the current science surrounding sports-related concussions \n(SRCs) and their related brain injuries, it's that very little is certain about the current science. \nThe field is surprisingly new. A significant scientific breakthrough occurred in 2002 when an \nAfrican-American neuropathologist in Pittsburgh named Bennet Omalu (played by Will Smith in \nthe 2015 movie Concussion) performed an autopsy on Hall of Fame center Mike Webster. Dr. \nOmalu identified abnormal clumps of the protein tau in Webster's brain, which he believed to \nbe evidence of CTE. Such proteins develop in tangles that slowly strangle neurons and, \nconsequently, inhibit brain function.  \nMany studies point to how dangerous football is to players' long-term brain health. Although \nthere is also research related to college players and younger, this case study focuses on the \nNFL. The studies show:  \n \nOver two regular seasons (2012-2014), NFL players sustained 4,384 injuries, including 301 \nconcussions. This statistic is up 61% from 2002-2007, perhaps reflecting an improvement of \nawareness and reporting (Lawrence et al. 2015).  \n \nIn a study of 14,000 NFL players, \nresearchers found that even head impacts \ninsufficient to cause concussions can mount \nup over the years, leading to CTE and \npremature death. An NFL player who plays \n24 games increases the likelihood of \npremature death by 16% (Ehrlich et al., \n2019). \n\n \nCase Study - Head Injuries & The NFL - Page 2 of 6 \n \n \nA 2019 study of the brains of 223 football players with CTE and 43 players without CTE \nfound that for each additional 2.6 years of play, the risk of developing CTE doubled (Mex et \nal. 2019). \nGiven the results of these studies, there has been a strong outcry against football, including at \nthe NFL level. The NFL initially pushed back against the implications of such research. Then, as \nevidence piled up, the NFL funded research itself about head injuries and also how to design \nsafer equipment. And, the NFL made rule changes in an attempt to make the game safer. The \nNFL has also changed rules to discourage helmet-to-helmet contact, and instituted protocols for \nsafely returning concussed players to the field.  \nDespite these changes, controversy continues because the science in this area is not settled. \nImportantly, standard medical imaging techniques do not show brain damage even when a \nplayer has had a concussion. And CTE cannot truly be diagnosed until the brain is examined \nafter death.  \nNeuropsychologist Munro Cullum argues: I worry the pendulum has swung too far. The reality \nis that we still don't know who is most likely to suffer a concussion, who will take longer to \nrecover, how anatomic or genetic differences influence concussions, and who may be at risk of \nprolonged symptoms or developing cognitive problems later in life. \nSome studies seem to indicate that concussions may be more benign than feared. For example: \n A 2016 study found no elevated risk of suicide in a population of players with at least \nfive years in the league (Lehman et al., 2016).  \n Another study of 35 former NFL players over age 50 who had sustained multiple \nconcussions during their careers found no significant association between the length \nof careers, the number of concussions, and their level of cognitive function later in \nlife (Mez et al., 2019).  \n A 2007 study found that retired NFL players experienced levels of depressive \nsymptoms no worse than those of the general population (Schwenk, 2007). \nSo, at the end of the day, the jury still seems to be out on the question of whether or not we \ncan go to a football game or watch one on television and still feel good about ourselves for \nsupporting a sport that arguably causes irreversible traumatic brain injuries.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nCase Study - Head Injuries & The NFL - Page 3 of 6 \n \nBibliography:\nSteve Almond, Is It Immoral to Watch the Super Bowl?, New York Times, Jan. 24, 2014.  \nMichael Alosco et al., Characterizing Tau Deposition in Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE): \nUtility of the McKee CTE Staging Scheme, Acta Neuropathologica 140: 495-512 (2020).  \nChristie Aschwanden, Football's Concussion Crisis is Awash with Pseudoscience, Wired.com, Oct. \n2, 2019. \nKathleen Bachynski & Daniel S.

        "1. One of the most influential studies of CTE in NFL players found that of 111 NFL players' brains that were donated for study, scientists diagnosed 110 with CTE (Mez et al, 2017). But this was not a random sample - the gold standard for research - of retired NFL players' brains. These brains had been donated by family members because the players had been exhibiting adverse symptoms before their death. Is your assessment of these results affected by the fact that family members donated these brains? If so, why? Explain.",
        "2. Another recent study performed by the University of Buffalo found no dementia among 21 retired professional football and hockey players who had played for the Buffalo Bills and the Buffalo Sabres (Willer et al., 2018). But this is a very small sample size, which is not the gold standard for research. Is this study more persuasive to you than the previous one? a. Would your mind change if you learned that the study was funded by a foundation set up by the founder and long-time owner of the Buffalo Bills? If so, why? b. What implications does the self-serving bias have for your assessment? c. Would you change your mind (again) if the scientists who performed the study indicated that the foundation played no role in selecting subjects, designing the study, analyzing the data, or preparing the report? If so, why? d. Even without such involvement by the foundation, might the scientists have a subconscious desire to produce results that would please the foundation in order to pave the way for future funding? Explain.",
        "3. The most influential standards for sports-related concussions come from the Concussion in Sport Group (CISG), which has published a new set of standards approximately every five years since 2001. An article by Casper and colleagues in 2021 criticized the CISG standards for adhering to a libertarian framing of causality, risk, and intervention, rather than a precautionary, public health, and patient-centered point of view (Casper et al.). They point out that the CISG has been dominated by individuals with close relationships to professional and amateur sports organizations. For example, many of the CISG's members have received research support from the NFL, and other sports organizations like FIFA, the International Olympic Committee, and the International Ice Hockey Federation. In light of the self-serving bias, how does this make you feel about the CISG consensus statements? Explain your reasoning. a. Would your opinion be affected by the fact that the lead author of the Casper article has been hired as an expert witness by firms representing plaintiffs in litigation against sports organizations worldwide? Why or why not?",

What is your opinion about how the self-serving bias might affect the judgments of team trainers and team physicians? b. Do you see a conflict of interest? Explain your reasoning",
        "5. The tobacco industry and pharmaceutical industry have long track records of funding and attempting to influence the results of research regarding their products. In their research, Bachynski and Goldberg accuse the NFL of doing the same. They give examples of the NFL pulling funding when researchers refused to remove a colleague who had been critical of the league from a research project. When the stakes are so high, is such conduct inevitable? Discuss. c. How can researchers guard against being unduly influenced or pressured in this way?",
        "6. The NFL has accused the media of overhyping the dangers of concussions and CTE in order to sell newspapers and subscriptions. Is this a plausible conflict-of-interest that could impact the media? Why or why not?",

      "content": "Case Study - LochteGate - Page 1 of 4 \n \nLochteGate \nRyan Lochte's career establishes him as one of America's greatest swimmers. He was a two-\ntime NCAA Swimmer of the Year, a 24-time NCAA All-American, and a 7-time NCAA champion. \nHe won twelve Olympic swimming medals, including the second most individual swimming \nmedals of all time in Men's swimming. At the Summer Olympics in 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, \nBrazil, Lochte won his final gold medal as a member of the USA Men's 4 x 200-meter relay \nteam.  \nThe USA team dominated the medal count in Rio. At the conclusion of the competition, Lochte \nleft the Olympic village to celebrate with three other USA swimmers, including one who was \nnot yet 21 and therefore was forbidden to leave the village.  \nDuring the course of their celebration, the four became intoxicated or otherwise impaired, \nwhich led to a very unfortunate situation. As reported by The New York Times: \nThey asked the taxi driver who was returning them to the athletes' village from a party \nto pull over at a gas station. \nWhat happened next remains murky but involved public urination, vandalism and \nmoney changing hands between the swimmers and security guards brandishing \nweapons. \nIn Lochte's original account, which he gave in a television interview with NBC the next \nmorning, he said the taxi had been stopped by armed men he believed were police \nofficers, one of whom held a gun against his head before taking cash from his wallet. \nHis story encapsulated the fears of Olympic visitors and the insecurities of a host city \nstruggling with high crime and gun battles between drug gangs and the police. \nAfter the Brazilian authorities opened their own investigation, Lochte altered his story \nand acknowledged that he had overexaggerated, but not before the events had \novershadowed the accomplishments of American athletes during the second week of \nthe Games. \nThe fall-out from Lochte's overexaggeration, which he made in an interview with Matt Lauer \non NBC television, was significant: \n \nMuch of the Brazilian population was \noutraged by an apparently false charge of \ncrime and police corruption. \n \nMuch anger was expressed at the athletes' \napparent display of privilege and disdain for \nBrazil. \n \nU.S. Olympic officials issued several \napologies for the four athletes' behavior. \n\n \nCase Study - LochteGate - Page 2 of 4 \n \n \nLochte himself issued multiple apologies, including this one: \n \nI wanted to apologize for my behavior last weekend--for not being more careful and candid in \nhow I described the events of that early morning and for my role in taking the focus away from \nthe many athletes fulfilling their dreams of participating in the Olympics. \n \nLochte was charged with providing a false claim of a robbery. The charge was later dismissed on \ngrounds that his actions didn't rise to the level of filing a false crime report. \n \nLochte was accused of being a liar in many news media reports. \n \nLochte lost all four of his major sponsors. \n \nLochte was suspended by the US Olympic Committee and USA Swimming for four months. \n \nLochte was required to complete 20 hours of community service. \n \nThe situation became known as LochteGate. \nIn a later interview, when asked why he had overexaggerated what happened, Lochte \nresponded: I think it's still hours after the incident and I'm not one to make excuses but I was \nstill intoxicated.

As they\nwaited, an employee asked if she could help them. They said no, that they were just waiting for a\nbusiness meeting.

At least six Philadelphia Police Department officers arrived. The\npolice officers did not ask the men any questions; they just demanded that they leave immediately.\nThey declined. The police officers then proceeded to arrest the men for trespassing. As the arrest\noccurred, Mr. Yaffe arrived. He said: Why would they be asked to leave?

      "content": "The Miss Saigon Controversy\nIn 1990, theatre producer Cameron Mackintosh brought the musical Miss Saigon to Broadway following a highly successful run in London. Based on the opera Madame Butterfly, Miss Saigon takes place during the Vietnam War and focuses on a romance between an American soldier and a Vietnamese orphan named Kim. In the musical, Kim is forced to work at 'Dreamland,' a seedy bar owned by the half-French, half-Vietnamese character 'the Engineer.' The production was highly anticipated, generating millions of dollars in ticket sales before it had even opened.\nControversy erupted, however, when producers revealed that Jonathan Pryce, a white British actor, would reprise his role as the Eurasian 'Engineer.' Asian American actor B.D. Wong argued that by casting a white actor in a role written for an Asian actor, the production supported the practice of yellow-face. Similar to blackface minstrel shows of the 19th and 20th centuries, yellow-face productions cast non-Asians in roles written for Asians, often relying on physical and cultural stereotypes to make broad comments about identity. Wong asked his union, Actors' Equity Association, to force Cameron Mackintosh and future producers to cast their productions with racial authenticity.\n\nActors' Equity Association initially agreed and refused to let Pryce perform: Equity believes the casting of Mr. Pryce as a Eurasian to be especially insensitive and an affront to the Asian community. Moreover, many argued that the casting of Pryce further limited already scarce professional opportunities for Asian American actors.\nFrank Rich of The New York Times disagreed, sharply criticizing the union for prioritizing politics over talent: A producer's job is to present the best show he can, and Mr. Pryce's performance is both the artistic crux of this musical and the best antidote to its more bloated excesses. It's hard to imagine another actor, white or Asian, topping the originator of this quirky role. Why open on Broadway with second best, regardless of race or creed? The casting director, Vincent G. Liff, also defended his actions on the same grounds: I can say with the greatest assurance that if there were an Asian actor of 45-50 years, with classical stage background and an international stature and reputation, we would have certainly sniffed him out by now.\nActors' Equity ultimately reversed their decision and Pryce performed the role of 'the Engineer' on Broadway to great acclaim. Nonetheless, the production remained controversial during its successful Broadway run. For many, it is seen as one of the most famous examples of contemporary yellow-face performance.",

      "content": "Case Study - Myanmar Amber - Page 1 of 3 \nMyanmar Amber \n \nAmber is a resin material that is formed from fossilized conifer tree sap during years of constant \npressure and heat. This yellow to reddish-brown translucent material has been used in a number of \nways, including to make jewelry, in Egyptian burials, and in the healing arts. Amber also plays an \ninvaluable role in research. In some cases, amber contains inclusions, such as insects, whole or parts of \nanimals, and plants that are trapped and preserved. The ability to hold a piece of history untouched by \ntime has resulted in a number of scientific discoveries and advances such as feathers on a non-avian \ndinosaur dated 99 million years ago and the biosynthesis of gene clusters for novel antibiotics. \n \nOne of the oldest amber deposits in the world, dating back 100 million years, is located in the Northern \nregion of Myanmar. Myanmar amber is plentiful, high quality and contains inclusions within the resin. \nThe mining of these amber specimens in Myanmar is the center of many legitimate and blackmarket \nsales to university researchers and private collectors alike. Over the last ten years, more than one \nbillion dollars in legal revenue has been generated from the mining and sale of amber. \n \nMyanmar is a small southeast Asian country that contains about 130 diverse ethnic groups recognized \nby the government. There is no official state religion but the Myanmar government favors the majority \nTheravada Buddhism population. This favoritism has created ethnic and religious conflicts resulting in \ngovernment-enforced discrimination. For example, the government has made it difficult for Christian \nand Islamic groups to gain permission to repair or build new places of worship. The Kachin \nIndependence Army, which includes ethnic minorities who live in the northern Kachin and surrounding \nregions of Myanmar, has been in armed conflict with the Myanmar government for the restoration of \nminority ethnic groups' rights.  \n \nFor many years this mining area has been protected by the Kachin Independence Army. However, in \n2017 the Myanmar government dropped leaflets from helicopters informing the population in \nnorthern Kachin that civilians and Kachin militants who remain in the region will be considered hostile \nopposition to the government military forces. The government then forced more than 5000 inhabitants \nfrom their homes and villages, as well as from the amber mines. This hostile takeover of the profitable \nKachin amber mines ensures that amber purchases from researchers and private collectors will help \nfund the government side of the Myanmar ethnic civil war.  \n \nWhile some researchers and universities feel as though they should refrain from making such amber \npurchases, their failure to participate enables many private collectors to remove collections from the \npublic or to charge researchers an exorbitant fee for access. \n \nFurthermore, many of the miners in the Kachin region, on both \nsides of the conflict, are not fully aware of the value of the amber \nthat they are selling and are therefore being exploited by the \nwholesalers who purchase from them.  Myanmar classifies amber \nas a gemstone, not a fossil, so it can be legally removed from the \ncountry, unlike fossils that have restrictions on removal. \n\n \nCase Study - Myanmar Amber - Page 2 of 3 \nResources:\n \nGammon, Katharine, The Human Cost of Amber, The Atlantic, Aug. 2, 2019.    \nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/08/amber-fossil-supply-chain-has-dark-human-\ncost/594601/ \n \nGrimaldi, David, Amber, Current Biology Magazine.  https://www.cell.com/current-\nbiology/pdf/S0960-9822(19)31097-8.pdf \n \nGreshko, Michael, Ancient Bird Foot Found in Amber Has Bizarrely Long Toes, National Geographic, \nJuly 11, 2019.   https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2019/07/fossil-bird-in-amber-has-\nunusually-long-toes/ \n \nLawton, Graham, Blood Amber: The Exquisite Trove of Fossils Fueling War in Myanmar, NewScientist, \nMay 1, 2019.  https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24232280-600-blood-amber-the-exquisite-\ntrove-of-fossils-fuelling-war-in-myanmar/ \n \nNelson, Alexandrea, The Materiality of Morality: Conflict Minerals, Utah Law Review, 2014: 1, p. 219 \n(2014).  https://dc.law.utah.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1121&context=ulr \n\n \nCase Study - Myanmar Amber - Page 3 of 3 \n \nSokol, Joshua, Troubled Treasure, Science, May 23, 2019.   \nhttps://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/05/fossils-burmese-amber-offer-exquisite-view-dinosaur-\ntimes-and-ethical-minefield \n \nThiha, Myanmar's New Gold Mine is Dinosaur Amber, July 11, 2018. https://consult-\nmyanmar.com/2018/07/11/myanmars-new-gold-mine-is-dinosaur-amber/ \n \nXing, Linda et al., A Feathered Dinosaur Tail with Primitive Plumage Trapped in Mid-Cretaceous \nAmber, Current Biology, 26: 24, pl. 3352 (Dec. 2016).   \nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982216311939?via%3Dihub \n \nDodging Rumour and Insurgency: The Hunt for Burmese Amber Goes to the Heart of Myanmar's \nTurbulent North, Financial Post, Jan. 26, 2017. \nhttps://business.financialpost.com/commodities/mining/dodging-rumour-and-insurgency-the-hunt-\nfor-burmese-amber-goes-to-the-heart-of-myanmars-turbulent-north \n \n It is Time to Bring Global Attention to the Trade in Burmese Amber, NewScientist, May 1, 2019.  \nhttps://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24232283-300-it-is-time-to-bring-global-attention-to-the-\ntrade-in-burmese-amber/ \n \nAuthor: \nChris Apgar and Robert Prentice \nThe University of Texas at Austin",

      "title": "Pao-Gender-Bias",
      "content": "Pao & Gender Bias\nOn May 10, 2012, executive Ellen Pao filed a lawsuit against her employer, Silicon Valley-based tech venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers (Kleiner Perkins), on grounds of gender discrimination. Pao began working at Kleiner Perkins in 2005. She became a junior investing partner, but after several years at the firm was passed over for a senior partner position and was eventually terminated. Pao claimed that men with similar profiles and achievements were promoted instead.\nIn late 2011, Pao and a coworker were asked by a senior partner to come up with ways of improving the firm's treatment of women, but the senior partner, according to Pao, was noncommittal. On January 4, 2012, Pao took this issue a step further and wrote a formal memorandum to several of her superiors and the firm's outside counsel. In the memorandum, she described harassment she had received while at the firm, claiming she had been excluded from meetings by male partners, and asserting an absence of training and policies to prevent discrimination at the firm. Pao's memo indicated that she wished to work with the firm on improving conditions for women. She was fired on October 1, 2012. The lawsuit went to trial in February 2015.\n\nIn a testimony during the trial, Pao explained that she sued because there was no process for HR issues at the firm and believed she had exhausted all options for addressing these issues internally: It's been a long journey, and I've tried many times to bring Kleiner Perkins to the right path. I think there should be equal opportunities for women and men to be venture capitalists. I wanted to be a VC but I wasn't able to do so in that environment. And I think it's important...to make those opportunities available in the future. And I wanted to make sure my story was told.\nPao's lawsuit made four claims against Kleiner Perkins: 1) they discriminated against Pao on the basis of gender by failing to promote her and/or terminating her employment; 2) they retaliated by failing to promote her because of conversations she had in late 2011 and/or the memo from January 4, 2012; 3) they failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent gender discrimination against her; and 4) they retaliated against her by terminating her employment because of conversations she had in late 2011 and/or the memo from January 4, 2012.\nPao's legal team argued that men were promoted ahead of women, women who experienced sexual harassment received little support, and women's ideas were often more quickly dismissed than men's. Pao's performance reviews revealed contradictory criticisms such as too bold and too quiet. Pao also accused company partner Ajit Nazre of\npressuring her into an affair and subsequently retaliating against her after she ended the relationship. She said she received an inappropriate gift containing erotic imagery and was present while men at the firm were making inappropriate conversation. Further, the legal team described how Pao and other women had been left out of certain meetings and gatherings.\n \nThe defense's case focused on Pao's performance and character, noting that Pao received several negative performance reviews and acted entitled or resentful toward other employees and was not a team player. Evidence included evaluations, self-evaluations, meeting summaries, and messages both personal and professional. Kleiner Perkins claimed that Pao was paid more than her male counterparts, including bonuses and training. The firm also argued that Pao's job description was mostly managerial and that limiting her involvement in investing was therefore not a form of discrimination.\nThe verdict was announced on March 27, 2015. The jury ruled 10 to 2 in favor of Kleiner Perkins on the first three claims, and 8 to 4 in favor of Kleiner Perkins on the fourth claim. Speaking after the trial, juror Steve Sammut said that the verdict came down to performance reviews, in which Pao's negative criticism remained consistent each year. But he added that he wished there was some way for Kleiner Perkins to be punished for its treatment of employees, It isn't good. It's like the wild, wild West. Juror Marshalette Ramsey voted in favor of Pao, believing Pao had been discriminated against. Ramsey stated that the male junior partners who were promoted had those same character flaws that Ellen was cited with.\n\nDeborah Rhode, law professor at Stanford University, said that even with this loss, Pao's lawsuit succeeded in prompting debate about women in venture capital and tech. She stated, This case sends a powerful signal to Silicon Valley in general and the venture capital industry in particular... Defendants who win in court sometimes lose in the world outside it. After the verdict was announced, Pao stated that she hoped the case at least helped level the playing field for women and minorities in venture capital. She later wrote, I have a request for all companies: Please don't try to silence employees who raise discrimination and harassment concerns. ...I hope future cases prove me wrong and show that our community and our jurists have now developed a better understanding of how discrimination works in real life, in the tech world, in the press and in the courts. Pao's case has since been credited for inspiring others facing workplace discrimination to act; similar lawsuits have been filed against companies such as Facebook, Twitter, and Microsoft.",

Following resignation, many Americans were angry with Nixon and also suspicious of Gerald Ford as he stepped into the presidential role. Nixon soon became extremely ill. On August 15, 1974, he was admitted to Bethesda Naval Hospital and diagnosed with viral pneumonia. One account suggests he was admitted with a recurrence of phlebitis. Nixon had a history of phlebitis, which can be fatal even if treated.\n\nOn September 8, 1974, President Ford issued a full and absolute pardon of Nixon for all offenses against the United States, making Nixon immune from any arrest, investigation, or imprisonment from his involvement in Watergate. The pardon infuriated many Americans. Suspicions arose of a possible deal between Ford and Nixon in exchange for Ford's prior nomination to vice president. All parties denied any such deal and no evidence in support of these allegations ever surfaced.\nWith the Watergate scandal consuming the nation, Ford signaled that he wanted to refocus the public and rebuild trust in the executive branch. He sought to move forward by concentrating on the nation's problems, such as ending the Vietnam War, rather than spending his entire administration dissecting the activities of the previous president for years to come. However, as a result of the pardon, Nixon would never be held accountable for activity widely thought to be criminal.\nPresident Ford also believed from reports and advisors that Nixon's health was seriously compromised and that his death was likely imminent. In his speech announcing the pardon, Ford referred both to the health crisis of Nixon as well as his own personal constitutional duty to ensure domestic tranquility. At the time, it was impossible for Ford to realize that Nixon would eventually recover and live for twenty more years. Ford believed he acted in the nation's best interests.

      "content": "Prenatal Diagnosis & Parental Choice\nIn the United States, many citizens agree that the government may impose limits on the freedom of individuals when individuals interfere with the rights of others, but the extent of these limits is often a topic of debate. Among the most debated of bioethical issues is the issue of abortion, which hinges on whether the fetus is a person with rights, notably the right to life.\nIn conjunction with the legal right to abortion affirmed in the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade, the issue of prenatal diagnosis has led to decisions by pregnant women to pursue abortion where prenatal testing has revealed genetic abnormalities in fetuses. However, this practice has met with recent opposition in the wake of research showing that between 60 and 90 percent of fetal diagnoses of Down syndrome have led to abortion. In 2015, legislation was introduced in the Ohio Legislature that would make it illegal to terminate a pregnancy for the purpose of avoiding giving birth to a baby with Down syndrome.\nThose opposed to this legislation have noted that such a law would violate the Roe v. Wade decision by the Supreme Court, and that laws based on intention or motivation to terminate would be unenforceable. This is interference with a medical decision following a complicated diagnosis, according to Kellie Copeland, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio, Not knowing the family and the circumstances, the legislature can't possibly take into account all the factors involved.\nSupporters of the legislation have described this as a way to limit the number of abortions in the state and protect babies born with disabilities. Mike Gonidakis,\npresident of Ohio Right to Life, stated, We all want to be born perfect, but none of us are, and everyone has a right to live, perfect or not. Rachel Mullen, a member of the Cuyahoga County chapter of Ohio Right to Life, said in an interview, we need this bill so that [babies with Down syndrome] can be born, and not culled.\n\n\nTeaching Note:\nBioethics examines the moral dimensions surrounding the use of medical technology, raising questions such as: Should all scientific advances in medicine be made available to all? Do some advances conflict with society's values and morals?

Most major news outlets reported on Marin County Sheriff's Lt. Keith Boyd's press conference, which revealed graphic details from the coroner's report about the methods Williams used. While there was great interest on the part of the public in finding out what happened, many argued that reporting too much detail about the suicide violated the family's privacy.\nIndeed, many of Robin Williams's fans posted on Facebook, Twitter, and other social networks to express their objections to the media treatment of the suicide, urging reporters to respect the family's right to grieve in peace. Several members of the mental health community also took issue with the detailed reports. Paul Farmer, chief executive of the mental health charity Mind, wrote to CNN that When a media report describes clear details of unusual methods of suicide and essentially gives a how to guide--the danger is it can make suicide seem like a more accessible action to take. Some journalists expressed similar viewpoints, criticizing the reports as a clear violation of media ethics.\nAccording to the Press Complaints Commission, When reporting suicide, care should be taken to avoid excessive detail about the method used.\nYet other journalists argued that the primary responsibility of the media was to report the story truthfully and factually. In an op-ed in the LA Times, Andrew Klavan wrote, The manner of Williams' death is public information. Journalists should report it as long as it remains of interest to the public. It is not a journalist's job to protect us from the ugly facts. Klavan argued that the journalist's duty is not to do good or be wise, but to report the whole story, which may in fact be a part of a larger story unfolding elsewhere. Sheriff Boyd similarly defended his own actions by stating that he had a duty to report the details as part of the public record.\n\nIn an interview with Today, Williams's daughter Zelda discussed how her father never sought to hide his problems, mentioning his openness about struggling with alcoholism. She stated, I think that one of the things that is changing, that is wonderful, is that people are finally starting to approach talking about illnesses that people can't immediately see...He didn't like people feeling like the things that were hard for them they should go through alone.",

      "content": "Case Study - The Sandusky Scandal - Page 1 of 5 \n \nThe Sandusky Scandal \nJoe Paterno was an amazingly successful football coach at The Pennsylvania State University \n(Penn State). He had been at Penn State for more than sixty years, since he started as an \nassistant coach in 1950. In 1966, he ascended to head coach and won 409 games, the most of \nany Division I college football coach ever. His overall record was 409-136-3, meaning that his \nteams averaged an amazing 8.9 wins per season. He held the record for most NCAA bowl \nappearances and wins. Paterno and his wife had also donated millions of dollars to many \ndifferent causes at Penn State, and he had helped raise billions more for the school. He was \nJoe Pa, a sainted figure on the Penn State campus. And he enjoyed more influence and actual \npower than the top administrators, including President Graham Spanier, Business Vice-\nPresident Gary Schultz, and Athletic Director Tim Curley.  \nA significant part of Paterno's success can be credited to Jerry Sandusky, who was an assistant \ncoach under Paterno for more than thirty years - from 1969 to 1999. Sandusky was his \ndefensive coordinator for the last 22 of those seasons. Not only was Sandusky a superlative \ndefensive coach, he (like Paterno) was widely admired for charitable work. In 1977, Sandusky \nfounded a program to aid disadvantaged and at-risk youths called Second Mile. But \nunfortunately, he was a sexual predator and used Second Mile to groom vulnerable young boys, \nmany of whom he molested. \nOn May 3, 1998, the mother of an 11-year-old Second Mile child reported to a local \npsychologist that Sandusky had given her son a bear hug in the shower while both were nude, \nwhich made the boy feel uncomfortable. For unconvincing reasons (that may have had to do \nwith the significant influence which football has in a college town), the police and campus \nauthorities listened to the uncredentialed counselor who thought Sandusky did not fit the \nprofile of a pedophile rather than to the credentialed psychologist who thought that Sandusky \ndid. The case was closed. Sandusky admitted that he had used poor judgment and promised not \nto shower with young boys in the future. \nE-mails showed that Spanier, Schultz, Curley, and Paterno all knew about the situation. Schultz \nwrote: Critical issue--contact with genitals? And: Is this opening of pandora's box? Other \nchildren? The four men were clearly relieved when charges were not brought. A public \nrelations nightmare was averted. They did nothing to reprimand Sandusky or limit his future \nactivities on campus with young boys. None of them attempted to contact the victim, according \nto historian Ronald Smith. \nSandusky retired in 1999. This apparently had \nnothing to do with the 1998 incident. He was \ngiven a generous retirement package, including \nunlimited access to the football locker room \nwhere he had showered with the 11-year-old \nboy the year before.  \n\n \nCase Study - The Sandusky Scandal - Page 2 of 5 \n \nIn early 2001, graduate assistant coach Mike McQueary went to Paterno's house on a Saturday \nmorning to tell him that he had seen Sandusky fondling a young boy in the football locker \nroom's shower facilities the night before. The fondling was of a sexual nature. A day later, \nPaterno told Curley and Schultz: Hey, we got a problem. Penn State President Spanier was \nsimilarly informed. The four kept the information quiet. \nThese men must have been relieved that the incident did not make the newspapers. They did \nnothing to reach out to the victim. As was the case three years before, e-mails among the four \nmen indicate that they decided not to report McQueary's information to the authorities. \nRather, they determined to assist [Sandusky]...to get him professional help. Spanier wrote: \nThe only downside for us is if the message isn't heard and acted upon, we become vulnerable \nfor not having reported it. \nSeven years later in 2008, a Second Mile student spoke up. He claimed that Sandusky was \nsexually abusing him while volunteering at the boy's high school. Although the wheels of justice \nground slowly, in 2011 a grand jury issued a report that accused Sandusky in graphic terms of \nsexually molesting eight children. The report also noted that Paterno, Spanier, Schultz, and \nCurley, who testified before the grand jury, had known about the earlier incidents but had done \nnothing about them.  \nWhen the Board of Trustees learned of their actions and inactions, it terminated Paterno's \ncontract and forced Spanier's resignation. Paterno died very soon after at the age of 86. \nPaterno alone admitted that he knew Sandusky's actions were of a sexual nature, although \nthere was substantial evidence that all four men knew this, too. Before he died, Paterno \napologized for backing away after reporting the 2001 McQueary information to Curley, and \nfor doing nothing else about it for ten more years. Paterno said:  It is one of the great sorrows \nof my life. With the benefit of hindsight, I wish I had done more.  \nCurley and Schultz were charged with perjury before the grand jury and for conspiring to keep \nSandusky's crimes hidden by failing to report his misdeeds to the child protective authorities or \nto the police. Spanier issued a statement supporting Curley and Schultz, but never issued a \nstatement of concern regarding Sandusky's victims. Later, Spanier was similarly charged.  \nThe Trustees commissioned a study by former FBI Director Louis Freeh's law firm. The study \ncondemned the four men, noting in part that Paterno was on notice for at least 13 years that \nSandusky ... was a probable pedophile. Freeh's report also stated that Mr. Paterno \npurposefully ignored this evidence, and that former Penn State President Spanier exhibited a \nstriking lack of empathy for Sandusky's victims by failing to inquire as to their safety and well-\nbeing.  \nSandusky was convicted by a jury on 45 counts of child molestation and the like. He was \nsentenced to a long prison term that meant, given his age, he would probably die in prison. \nSchultz and Curley pled guilty to misdemeanor child endangerment charges in return for the \nauthorities dropping their felony charges. Spanier was convicted by a jury of failing to notify \n\n \nCase Study - The Sandusky Scandal - Page 3 of 5 \n \npolice of the 2001 abuse. All three served short jail terms. In sentencing the three men, the \njudge commented: Why no one made a phone call to the police ... is beyond me. \n \nBibliography:\nJohn Barr, How Key Figures from Jerry Sandusky's Crimes View Joe Paterno's Legacy 10 Years \nafter His Downfall, ESPN, Apr. 18, 2022, at https://www.espn.com/college-\nfootball/story/_/id/33743088/how-key-figures-jerry-sandusky-crimes-view-joe-paterno-legacy-\n10-years-downfall. \nJoe Drape, Sandusky Guilty of Sexual Abuse of 10 Young Boys, New York Times, June 22, 2012, \nat  \nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/23/sports/ncaafootball/jerry-sandusky-convicted-of-\nsexually-abusing-boys.html \nSarah Ganim, Joe Paterno May Have Known of Earlier Jerry Sandusky Abuse Claim, Police \nReport Reveals, CNN, Sept. 9, 2017, at  \nhttp://www.cnn.com/2017/09/09/us/penn-state-paterno-sandusky-police-report/index.html \nWill Hobson, What Did Joe Paterno Really Know about the Sandusky Scandal at Penn State? \nWashington Post, April 7, 2018, at  \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/sports/wp/2018/04/07/what-did-joe-paterno-really-\nknow-about-the-sandusky-scandal-at-penn-state/ \nEvan Osnos, The Big House: Life After White-Collar Crime, New Yorker, Aug. 30, 2021, \nPenn State Scandal Fast Facts \nhttp://www.cnn.com/2013/10/28/us/penn-state-scandal-fast-facts/ \nPenn State Abuse Scandal: A Guide And Timeline \nhttps://www.npr.org/2011/11/08/142111804/penn-state-abuse-scandal-a-guide-and-timeline \nJoe Posnanski, Paterno (2012). \nArnold William Rachman, Psychoanalysis and Society's Neglect of the Sexual Abuse of Children, \nYouth and Adults: Re-Addressing Freud's Original Theory of Sexual Abuse and Trauma, pp. 178-\n191 (2022).   \n\n \nCase Study - The Sandusky Scandal - Page 5 of 5 \n \nRonald A.

      "questions": [
        "1. By all accounts, Paterno, Spanier, Schultz, and Curley were honorable men who led decent lives. Many people criticized them for protecting the Penn State brand at the expense of children in how they handled the Sandusky scandal. Is this fair criticism? Why or why not?",
        "2. By 2001, Paterno had been at Penn State for 51 years and clearly loved the institution. Graham Spanier had been on the Penn State faculty from 1973-1982 and had been its President since 1995. Tim Curley was born and raised in State College, PA., went to Penn State as a student, and then worked in the athletic department, where he rose to the top of the organizational chart. Gary Schultz graduated from Penn State in 1971 and then worked there for forty more years. In other words, all four men were heavily invested in the university. They clearly understood the immediate, tangible, and significant harm that a sexual molestation scandal involving one of the campus's most visible and beloved figures would have upon Penn State's image, and its brand. On the other hand, the four men did not know Sandusky's victims. They did not know their names. They did not know their faces. And the evidence seems to indicate that they went to great lengths not to know anything about the victims. The victims must have seemed very abstract to Paterno, Spanier, Curley, and Schultz. Could the bias of the tangible and the abstract have played a role in the bad decisions made by these good men?  Explain your conclusions and the reasoning behind them.",
        "3. In 1991, if the four men had reported to the police or to child welfare authorities the McQueary information, it seems very likely that (in light of what had happened in 1998) they would have had a public scandal threatening damage to the Penn State brand. Is it possible these men thought to themselves: Maybe he didn't do it. And if he did it, maybe he did it only once. And if he did it more than once, maybe the victims won't complain publicly. And if they do complain, maybe no one will believe them. And if they do believe them, maybe this will happen off in the future and be the next president's (or coach's, or athletics director's) problem. Could such thinking have kept the problem at an abstract level in the men's minds rather than a tangible reality? Do you agree or disagree? Why or why not?",
        "4. Harvard's Eugene Soltes has found that white collar crime tends to occur more frequently when the perpetrators have no personal contact with the victims of their wrongdoing. This reduces their feelings that they are harming others and, therefore, that they are doing anything wrong. Does this finding have relevance for the Sandusky scandal? Explain your reasoning. a. Do you think the Penn State Four might have acted differently if they had met any Sandusky's many victims? If so, how? b. Would these men have acted the same had they known the victims? Or if the victims had been their own children? Explain.",
        "5. What other behavioral ethics concepts in this series might have had an impact here? What about the self-serving bias? What about role morality? How might these biases have factored into the men's choices and actions. Explain."

      "content": "Something Fishy at the Paralympics\nSome of sports' most inspiring and heart-warming stories have come from the Special Olympics (for\nathletes with intellectual disabilities) and the Paralympics (for athletes with intellectual impairments\nand visual or physical disabilities). The Paralympic games are held in parallel with the Olympics every\nfour years and have become a very big deal. Sports Illustrated reports that Paralympic sport has\ngrown into big business, with countries and sponsors pouring in millions of dollars to fund and\npromote athletes whose stories highlight the best of humanity.1 Australian Paralympians are\nsometimes provided tens of thousands of dollars in government funding and other perks, including\ncollege scholarships, vehicles, and housing.2 In the 2020 Paralympics, U.S. athletes were slated to\nreceive $37,500 for each gold medal they won.\nUnfortunately, sometimes Paralympians cheat much like regular Olympians have been known to do--\nthey take illicit drugs3 or they drive their blood pressure up (boosting) to drive heart rate and\nimprove performance.4 And, unsurprisingly, the Russians systematically cheat in the Paralympics just as\nthey do in the traditional Olympics.5 But the most significant cheating involves gaming the\nInternational Paralympic Committee's (IPC's) classification system.\nThe IPC classifies the disabilities of competitors in order to provide a structure for competition. Fair\ncompetition thrives only if athletes have similar levels of disabilities, so athletes are grouped into\nclasses based on how much their impairment\naffects fundamental activities in each specific\nsport and discipline.6\nObviously, by pretending to have a more serious\ndisability than they actually do, athletes could\nconvince officials to group them with athletes of\nlesser abilities. And there is evidence that this has\nhappened. For example, among the wrongdoing7:\n Swimmers tape their arms for days, removing the tape just before classification. Because of the\ntaping, they are unable to fully extend their arms.\n Athletes arrive for the classification in a wheelchair when they do not otherwise use\nwheelchairs, or wearing braces that they normally do not wear.\n Athletes submerge in cold water or roll in snow soon before classification to worsen muscle\ntone.\n Athletes intentionally perform below their ability (tanking) in assessment races.\nCase Study - Something Fishy at the Paralympics - Page 1 of 5\n Remarkably, even the shortening and removal of limbs has reportedly occurred.\nThe most infamous example of Paralympic cheating was by Spain's basketball team at the 2000 Sydney\nParalympics: none of the 12 players was mentally disabled as represented.8 Recently several\nParalympians, especially Para-swimmers, have claimed that cheating the classification system is\nepidemic.9\nAfter the Spanish basketball team was finally punished in 2017, the IPC removed basketball as a\nParalympic sport until officials could prove to the IPC's satisfaction that they had the classification\nproblem under control.10\nAnd, after believable allegations of widespread classification cheating among Australian\nParalympians,11 Australia has launched an online course that is mandatory for all its Paralympic\nathletes. The course outlines the classification process and requirements for all staff, coaches and\nathletes, explains penalties for noncompliance, and trains everyone on ethical decision making.12\nAt this time, the 2020 Tokyo Paralympics, along with the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, have been postponed\ndue to the COVID-19 pandemic. Whether or not the increased visibility (and awareness) of Paralympic\ncheating changes the way these games are played in the future remains to be seen.\nCase Study - Something Fishy at the Paralympics - Page 2 of 5",

        "5. The coach who recruited the 2000 Spanish Paralympic basketball team has reportedly built a fortune by collecting state money aimed to support disabled athletes.13 Does the self-serving bias play a role in motivating cheating? How so? By the coaches? By the athletes? Explain.",
        "6. It has been reported that the consciences of the 12 non-disabled semi-professional Spanish basketball players who entered the Sydney Paralympics of 2000 (and won the gold medal) were eased by the President of Spain's Federation for Mentally Disabled Sports. He told them that fake Paralympians were commonplace in every sport at the Paralympics.14 Does this sound like the conformity bias in action? Why or why not? a. Is this assertion defensible intellectually, or is it just a massive rationalization?",
        "7. It has been suggested that cheating by athletes in the Paralympics reinforces a stereotype held by many that people often pretend to be disabled in order to qualify for government payments and are therefore cheats?15 Is reinforcement of this false narrative a damaging result of the cheating scandal? Why or why not? a. Do you think this negative outcome was foreseen by the wrongdoers? b. Can you think of other collateral impacts?",
        "8. It has been argued that because the Paralympics are about winning (just like all sports) and that sometimes people in other sports cheat, it is no big deal that Paralympians cheat. Indeed, [s]ome Paralympians and disability-rights speakers take doping scandals as positive news. They say it proves disabled people can achieve the same things as anyone else, including cheating. People, they argue, can identify more with a role model who has made mistakes.16 Do you find this a convincing argument? Explain.",
        "9. Paralympian gold medal winner Bethany Woodward gave back her gold medal in the relays because one of her teammates was insufficiently disabled and therefore gave her team an unfair advantage. Woodward said, Paralympic sport is about disabled people pushing themselves and overcoming their disability. Handing back this medal will mean all the medals I Case Study - Something Fishy at the Paralympics - Page 3 of 5 won are to do with me, my cerebral palsy and my strength.17 This act has been mocked by Jim Moore, who wrote: Para sport is either about inspiration porn, and giving 'special people' a little something to do in between putting us all back in a box. Or it's about what all other sport is about: winning.18 Do you agree with Moore? Do you admire Woodward? Both? Neither? Support your position.",
        "10. Athletes like Bethany Woodward and U.S. Para-swimmer Jessica Long have been trying to call attention to cheating in the Paralympics. But they have been criticized by fellow Para-athletes for causing a furor that threatens to tear the sport apart and thereby damage it irrevocably.19 Some think that Woodward and Long should just shut up. Do you? Why or why not?",
        "11. Are the steps being taken by the IPC (banning basketball until the sport can clean up its act) and individual countries like Australia (with its online training course) necessary? Are they sufficient? Explain your reasoning. Author: Robert Prentice, J.D.

      "title": "Therac-25-1",
      "content": "Case Study - Therac-25 - Page 1 of 3 \nTherac-25 \n \nThe Therac-25 machine was a state-of-the-art linear accelerator developed by the company Atomic \nEnergy Canada Limited (AECL) and a French company CGR to provide radiation treatment to cancer \npatients. The Therac-25 was the most computerized and sophisticated radiation therapy machine of its \ntime. With the aid of an onboard computer, the device could select multiple treatment table positions \nand select the type/strength of the energy selected by the operating technician. AECL sold eleven \nTherac-25 machines that were used in the United States and Canada beginning in 1982. \n \nUnfortunately, six accidents involving significant overdoses of radiation to patients resulting in death \noccurred between 1985 and 1987 (Leveson & Turner 1993). Patients reported being burned by the \nmachine which some technicians reported, but the company thought was impossible. The machine \nwas recalled in 1987 for an extensive redesign of safety features, software, and mechanical interlocks. \nReports to the manufacturer resulted in inadequate repairs to the system and assurances that the \nmachines were safe. Lawsuits were filed, and no investigations took place. The Food and Drug \nAdministration (FDA) later found that there was an inadequate reporting structure in the company, to \nfollow up with reported accidents. \n \nThere were two earlier versions of the Therac-25 unit: the Therac-6 and the Therac-20, which were \nbuilt from the CGR company's other radiation units--Neptune and Sagittaire. The Therac-6 and Therac-\n20 units were built with a microcomputer that made the patient data entry more accessible, but the \nunits were operational without an onboard computer. These units had built-in safety interlocks and \npositioning guides, and mechanical features that prevented radiation exposure if there was a \npositioning problem with the patient or with the components of the machine. There was some base \nduplication of the software used from the Therac-20 that carried over to the Therac-25. The Therac-6 \nand Therac-20 were clinically tested machines with an excellent safety record. They relied primarily on \nhardware for safety controls, whereas the Therac-25 relied primarily on software.   \n \nOn February 6, 1987, the FDA placed a shutdown on all machines until permanent repairs could be \nmade. Although the AECL was quick to state that a fix was in place, and the machines were now \nsafer, that was not the case. After this incident, Leveson and Turner (1993) compiled public \ninformation from AECL, the FDA, and various regulatory agencies and concluded that there was \ninadequate record keeping when the software was \ndesigned. The software was inadequately tested, and \npatches were used from earlier versions of the machine. \nThe premature assumption that the problem(s) was \ndetected and corrected was unproven. Furthermore, AECL \nhad great difficulty reproducing the conditions under \nwhich the issues were experienced in the clinics. The FDA \nrestructured its reporting requirements for radiation \nequipment after these incidents. \n \n\n \nCase Study - Therac-25 - Page 2 of 3 \nAs computers become more and more ubiquitous and control increasingly significant and complex \nsystems, people are exposed to increasing harms and risks.  The issue of accountability arises when a \ncommunity expects its agents to stand up for the quality of their work. Nissenbaum (1994) argues that \nresponsibility in our computerized society is systematically undermined, and this is a disservice to the \ncommunity. This concern has grown with the number of critical life services controlled by computer \nsystems in the governmental, airline, and medical arenas. \n \nAccording to Nissenbaum, there are four barriers to accountability: the problem of many hands, bugs \nin the system, the computer as a scapegoat, and ownership without liability. The problem of too many \nhands relates to the fact that many groups of people (programmers, engineers, etc.) at various levels of \na company are typically involved in creation of a computer program and have input into the final \nproduct. When something goes wrong, there is no one individual who can be clearly held responsible.  \nIt is easy for each person involved to rationalize that he or she is not responsible for the final outcome, \nbecause of the small role played.  This occurred with the Therac-25 that had two prominent software \nerrors, a failed microswitch, and a reduced number of safety features compared to earlier versions of \nthe device. The problem of bugs in the software system causing errors in machines under certain \nconditions has been used as a cover for careless programming, lack of testing, and lack of safety \nfeatures built into the system in the Therac-25 accident. The fact that computers always have \nproblems with their programming cannot be used as an excuse for overconfidence in a product, \nunclear/ambiguous error messages, or improper testing of individual components of the system. \nAnother potential obstacle is ownership of proprietary software and an unwillingness to share trade \nsecrets with investigators whose job it is to protect the public (Nissenbaum 1994). \n \nThe Therac-25 incident involved what has been called one of the worst computer bugs in history (Lynch \n2017), though it was largely a matter of overall design issues rather than a specific coding error.  \nTherac-25 is a glaring example of what can go wrong in a society that is heavily dependent on \ntechnology.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nCase Study - Therac-25 - Page 3 of 3 \nResources:\n \nGotterbarn, Donald, Software Engineering Ethics, Encyclopedia of Software Engineering (2002), \nhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/0471028959.sof314.  \n \nLeveson, Nancy & Turner, Clark, An Investigation of the Therac-25 Accidents, Computer 26:7, p. 18 \n(July 19993), https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs240/old/sp2014/readings/therac-25.pdf \nLeveson, Nancy, Medical Devices: The Therac--25 (1995),  http://sunnyday.mit.edu/papers/therac.pdf.  \n \nLynch, Jamie, Therac-25 Causes Radiation Overdoses, Bugsnag Blog (2017)  \nhttps://www.bugsnag.com/blog/bug-day-race-condition-therac-25 \nNissenbaum, Helen, Computing and Accountability, Communications of the ACM, 37:1, p. 73 (1994). \nhttp://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/180000/175228/p72-\nnissenbaum.pdf?ip=128.62.211.38&id=175228&acc=ACTIVE%20SERVICE&key=603D2E7028CD4EF5%2\nE4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35&__acm__=1576603038_0292b\n9d0b31643bd7b06dde8efa509f7 \n \nAuthor: \nChris Apgar and Robert Prentice \nThe University of Texas at Austin",

      "content": "Cheating: UNC's Academic Fraud\nIn the summer of 2007, a football player at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill (UNC) took a\n400-level course in the Department of African and Afro-American Studies (AFAM) and received a B+.\nThe student athlete was about to enter his freshman year at UNC--in the fall of 2007--yet he took an\nupper-level class before completing a 100- or 200-level course. A syllabus for the summer course did\nnot exist. Most freshmen at UNC were not typically allowed to take 400-level courses without special\npermission from professors or advanced placement.\nThis and other cases were a part of the evidence in allegations of academic fraud against UNC in a\nreport released by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in 2015. The report references\nunchecked coursework in which many student-athletes at UNC enrolled in fraudulent classes in the\nAFAM department or were given special advantages over the course of 18 years. As the report stated,\nThese were classes that involved no interaction with a faculty member, required no class attendance\nor course work other than a single paper, and resulted in consistently high grades.\nJulius Nyang'oro, professor and department chair of AFAM, oversaw this system. Deborah Crowder,\nwho was a secretary with the department, operated the paper classes, often categorized as\nindependent study courses. Several counselors in UNC's Office of Academic Support Program for\nStudent Athletes also knew of these classes. In some cases, the counselors steered students to them.\nThese courses enabled student-athletes with poor academic performance to continue to be eligible to\nplay sports. The courses were also open to non-athletes and became popular among fraternity\nmembers.\nUltimately, the scheme became so brazen that an academic counselor wrote an e-mail to Ms. Crowder\nthat said: Hi, Debby. Yes, a D will be fine; that's all she needs. I didn't look at the paper but figured out\nit was a recycled one as well, but I couldn't figure out from where! Thanks for whatever you can do.\nMany of the staff members implicated in the allegations were named by Mary Willingham, a learning\nspecialist at UNC who went public with details about the ongoing operations. I was part of something\nthat I came to be ashamed of, she said, We weren't serving the kids. We weren't educating them\nproperly. We were pushing them toward graduation, and that's not the same as giving them an\neducation.\nThe concern over giving student-athletes an education\nraised larger questions about the balance between\nstrong academics and strong athletics at major\nuniversities. Richard Southall, director of the College\nSport Research Institute at the University of South\nCarolina, stated, We pretend that it's feasible to\nrecruit high school graduates with minimal academic\nqualifications, give them a full-time job as a football or\nbasketball player at a Division I NCAA school, and\nCase Study - Cheating: UNC's Academic Fraud - Page 1 of 4\nsomehow have them get up to college-level reading and writing skills at the same time that they're\nenrolled in college-level classes. He added, We're kidding ourselves.\nThe Southern Association of Colleges and Schools accreditation organization placed UNC on probation\nfor one year. UNC instituted reforms with higher governance standards, accountability for student-\nathlete support programs, and classroom and coursework audits. In 2017, the NCAA concluded its\ninvestigation. While the organization agreed that UNC was guilty of academic fraud, it did not punish\nthe university or its athletic program. The NCAA's infractions committee declared that it did not have\nthe power to levy penalties against the university because the paper courses were not exclusive to\nstudent-athletes but were accessible to any UNC student.",

      "title": "Varsity-Blues-Scandal_Role-Morality_Case-Study_English-2",
      "content": "Case Study - The Varsity Blues Scandal - Page 1 of 5 \n \nThe Varsity Blues Scandal \nRick Singer was an independent college counselor who held the golden ticket for his clients. He \nhad concocted a side door that guaranteed admission to the college of a student's choice. \nStudents could enter the front door of a college by using the normal admissions process, \nwhich meant making the necessary grades and test scores and engaging in the appropriate \nextra-curricular activities to gain a thumbs up from the college's admissions committee. Or, \nstudents could enter the back door of a college when their parents donated large sums of \nmoney - say $20 million or so - to the school, which pretty much guaranteed that the school \nwould not deny their childrens' applications for admission. \nIn Singer's model, the side door was a little more complicated. He had learned that many \nuniversities' non-revenue sports programs underpaid their coaches. These coaches had the \nability to label applicants as athletes, which sent them to the front of the admissions line and \nmade their admission to the school a near certainty. So, if Singer promised donations from \nparents that would go to these sports' budgets and/or directly into the pockets of these \ncoaches, he could tell his clients: If we just pretend that your child is a fencer (or a rower, or a \ntennis athlete, or a soccer athlete, etc.), and you donate $X to my foundation, I can funnel that \nmoney to Coach Y and admission will be guaranteed. \nAnother way to use Singer's side door was to improve standardized test scores, which he also \nrigged. Singer had bribed people who administered standardized tests at a site in Houston and \na site in Los Angeles. If parents could get their child certified as needing special \naccommodations for taking the exam (ideally, extra time over several days), and could also \nmake up an excuse for having their child take the test at one of these locations (instead of their \nnormal site), then Singer could manipulate the child's test score. He had a ringer who would \neither take the test for the student, or make enough corrections on the student's test before it \nwas turned in, to acquire the desired score.  \nSinger pursued clients of children who were rich. As the scheme progressed, he pursued richer \nand richer parents. He also cultivated relationships with coaches at more and more prestigious \nuniversities (Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Georgetown, USC, University of Texas at Austin, etc.). \nSinger was clever in playing on parents' insecurities and devotion to their children. He would \ncommonly begin by counseling students in the typical way--what courses to take, what \nactivities to participate in, and so on. He would also advise students regarding their choice of \nschools, often getting their heart set on a \nparticular school. Then, OMG!! He would tell \nthe parents that their child had no chance of \ngetting into their dream school on their own. \nBut, TA-DA!! He had a side door that could do \nthe job.  \nSinger suggested to parents that they simply \ntake a picture of their child playing water polo \n\n \nCase Study - The Varsity Blues Scandal - Page 2 of 5 \n \n(or soccer or tennis, etc.) or Photoshop their child's face onto the body of someone playing that \nsport. He then advised parents to be prepared to make a sizeable donation (a little over one \nmillion dollars was the largest single donation he acquired) and admission to the school of their \nchild's choice was guaranteed. Singer would funnel some of the donation to the coach and \nusually some to the school. The coach would request that the student be put on a preferred \nadmission list for athletes, and admission was sure to follow. The student would show up at \nschool the next year, claiming an injury, and later retire from the sport.  \nIt turns out that wealthy people love their kids and want their dreams to come true, just like \neveryone else. And rich people are just as insecure about being parents as everyone else. While \na couple of the parents Singer dealt with were jerks (and at least one was a criminal), most \nwere good people and loving parents. For example, Douglas Hodge was a top executive at one \nof the world's biggest bond companies and a tremendous philanthropist. Gordie Caplan was the \nco-managing partner of a major law firm who constantly preached acting with integrity to his \nfirm's young lawyers. Felicity Huffman was an actor who also blogged about being a mom, \nselling Good Enough Mom mugs, and advising her readers not to try to be supermoms or to \nraise perfect kids. Writer Jane Buckingham's mantra was to 'try to take joy in who my kids ARE \nnot who I want them to be. \nBut all these parents, and many more, actively engaged in Singer's schemes of fraud and \nbribery in order to get their children into the schools their children desired. Many had deep \nreservations about the morality of what they were doing. As Huffman drove her daughter to \nthe site of the SAT test that was to be manipulated, she told herself: Turn around, turn around, \nturn around. But she didn't. \nInterestingly, most parents (though not all) went to great lengths to ensure that their children \ndid not know about the cheating. They wanted their kids to believe that they had been \nadmitted to these colleges on their own merit.  \nCollege admissions' processes have had scandals over the years, but the so-called Varsity \nBlues scandal is the biggest one in the history of the college admissions process. When Singer's \nschemes were ultimately discovered by the FBI, he went to prison. Many of the parents \ninvolved also went to prison, though for shorter periods. And many parents lost their jobs when \ntheir wrongs were publicized.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nCase Study - The Varsity Blues Scandal - Page 3 of 5 \n \nBibliography:\nNick Anderson, From 'Master Coach' to a Bribery Probe: A College Consultant Who Went off \nthe Rails, Washington Post, March 12, 2019. \nDevin Barrett & Matt Zapotosky, FBI Accuses Wealthy Parents, Including Celebrities, in College-\nEntrance Bribery Scheme, Washington Post March 12, 2019. \nBrian Davis, Texas Tennis Coach Michael Center Among Coaches Charged in Sweeping College \nAdmissions Scheme, Austin American-Statesman, March 12, 2019. \nDaniel Golden, The Price of Admission (2006). \nMariah Haas & Tyler McCarthy, Lori Loughlin, Mossimo Giannulli sentenced in college \nadmissions scandal case, Fox News, Aug. 21, 2020, \nat https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/lori-loughlin-mossimo-giannulli-sentenced-\ncollege-admissions-scandal \nDaniel Houser et al., On the Origins of Dishonesty: From Parents to Children, NBER Working \nPaper #20897 (Jan. 2015). \nMelissa Korn & Jennifer Levitz, Unacceptable: Privilege, Deceit & the Making of the College \nAdmissions Scandal (2020). \nNicole LaPorte, Guilty Admissions: The Bribes, Favors, and Phonies Behind the College Cheating \nScandal (2021).  \nJennifer Medina et al., College Admissions Scandal: Actresses, Business Leaders and Other \nWealthy Parents Charged, New York Times, March 12, 2019. \nAnita Raghavan, A Rogue Trader Blames the System, but Not All Are Persuaded, New York \nTimes, March 24, 2017. \nJohn Wertheim, He Got Punished.

      "questions": [
        "1. How did this happen? Why did the parents do it? With a couple of exceptions, most of Singer's clients led honorable lives and seem unlikely to have paid bribes in order to advance their own careers or financial situations. But these parents were willing to do so in order to get their kids into the college of their choice. Is it possible that while playing the role of loving parent, these parents thought they had to do these things to protect their kids from disappointment and failure? Could role morality have played a part here? Explain.",
        "2. According to Korn and Levitz, while working with Singer, mother Jane Buckingham wanted (more than anything) to help her son. Her main thought was: If there's something I can do, I should do it. Does this sound like a person playing the role of devoted parent? Why or why not?",
        "3. Psychologist Daniel Houser and colleagues ran an experiment where parents were given the opportunity to cheat under various circumstances. They found that parents were most likely to cheat when (a) it benefited their children rather than themselves, and (b) the children were not present. When children were present, parents cheated less, presumably to model good behavior for their kids. Does this experimental result seem to accord with the facts on the ground in the Varsity Blues scandal? Explain your reasoning.",
        "4. Regarding role morality, psychologist Keith Levitt has explained: When people switch hats, they often switch moral compasses. People like to think they are inherently moral creatures - you either have character or you don't. But our studies show that the same person may make a completely different decision based on what hat they may be wearing at the time, often without even realizing it.  Does this passage help explain how Gordie Caplan could preach integrity while playing the role of head of a law firm, yet cheat while playing the role of devoted parent? Or how Doulas Hodge could be a great philanthropist while playing the role of good citizen while being a cheater while playing the role of devote parent? Discuss.",
        "5. Kweku Adoboli was a trader for UBS who went to jail after sustaining a $2.3 billion loss. Later Adoboli commented: I don't think at any stage I felt guilty of committing a crime,' he said, 'Everything I had done was for the bank and for my colleagues. In other words, he was playing the role of loyal employee, trying to make a profit for his bank and therefore felt justified in entering into the unauthorized trades that led to the loss. Regarding the Varsity Blues scandal, Korn and Levitz wrote: [Jane] Buckingham didn't let herself think much about it. She knew that this was cheating, even if she wasn't picturing a federal crime. She told no one. But it also seemed like a straightforward way to solve a problem. Singer was going to help make this better. She knew it was wrong but not that wrong, right? [Her son] Jack would just get into the schools he was supposed to get into if she and Marcus [her husband from whom she was separated] had been better parents. a. Do you see parallels between Adoboli's playing the role of good and loyal employee and Buckingham playing the role of devoted parent? Explain. b. How did both use their roles to give themselves permission to do something they knew was wrong?",
        "6. When parents told themselves that they needed to pay a bribe to prevent their kids from being crushed by the disappointment of being rejected by their favored school, is it possible that they were also strongly (if subconsciously) motivated by the disappointment they would feel if their kids didn't get into the school of their choice, and by the desire to claim the bragging rights that go with your kids getting into prestigious schools? a. Did the self-serving bias also play a part here? Why or why not? b. Which do you think was the stronger influence - role morality or the self-serving bias? Explain your reasoning.",
        "7. Was framing also an issue here? Did the parents' overwhelming focus on the desired outcome--admission for their children--push moral considerations out of the parents' frame of reference when they were deciding whether or not to go along with Singer's schemes? What do you think and why?",
        "8. According to Nicole LaPorte: Singer was 'good at getting inside these guys' heads,' said one source. 'He'd talk about famous, wealthy kids who went to certain universities and say: You think they got in on their smarts.? He made it sound like everyone got into college through connections and giving money, building libraries.'  If this is accurate, might the conformity bias also have played a role here, making the frauds and bribes seem innocuous to the parents because everybody does it? Explain."

      "title": "Birthing-Vaccine-Skepticism",
      "content": "Birthing Vaccine Skepticism\nAndrew Wakefield, the child of two physicians, graduated from medical school in England in 1981 and\nembarked upon a research career in gastroenterology. He was particularly interested in the causes of\nCrohn's disease, an inflammatory bowel disease. After a fellowship at the University of Toronto,\nWakefield became a lab researcher at the Royal Free Hospital in London in 1988.\nWakefield developed a theory that the measles virus caused Crohn's disease and formed an\nInflammatory Bowel Disease Study Group. In May of 1995, the distraught mother of an autistic child\nphoned Wakefield and suggested that her son's condition had been caused by the measles virus in the\nMMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine. Of interest to Wakefield was the fact that the child also\napparently suffered from symptoms consistent with inflammatory bowel disease, which the mother\nsuspected were also caused by the MMR vaccine. Wakefield and his team began to study the mother's\nhypothesis. From July 1996 to February 1997, the team solicited referral letters from doctors of\nchildren who appeared to have both autism and inflammatory bowel issues. Ultimately, the team\nstudied twelve children.\nOn February 28, 1998, the team published an article in the prestigious medical journal, The Lancet.\nThe article listed twelve co-authors but was actually solely written by Wakefield. It proposed a\npotential link between the MMR vaccine and a bowel-brain syndrome causing both regressive\nautism (where children lost abilities such as speech that they had once had) and Crohn's disease. Even\nbefore publication of the article, Wakefield had told the press that the results of his research clearly\nconfirm our suspicions. At a press conference following publication, Wakefield said: I cannot support\nthe continued use of the three vaccines given together. My concerns are that one more case of this is\ntoo many. The article attracted much publicity and had a significant effect on the public's views\nregarding vaccination. What was unknown at that time included:\n On February 19, 1996, Wakefield had agreed to be a well-paid consultant to attorney Richard\nBarr who had been awarded a contract by the British Legal Aid Board to potentially file a class\naction lawsuit over the MMR vaccine.\n Barr and Wakefield had developed a list of things that Wakefield's research needed to show in\norder to be helpful to Barr's lawsuit even before the study began.\n Barr largely funded Wakefield's research project using government funds allocated to the\nlawsuit.\n Many of the twelve children in the study had ties\nto Barr or to anti-vaccine groups; they had gone\nto the hospital with their parents already intent\nupon suing the vaccine makers.\n To gather information for the study, Wakefield\nand his team subjected the twelve children to\nendoscopies, a procedure that was high risk,\nCase Study - Birthing Vaccine Skepticism - Page 1 of 7\neven though many of the children had no medical need for the procedure. Wakefield did not\ndisclose that his team did not have ethics committee approval to perform these risky,\nunnecessary procedures.\n In June 1996, Wakefield filed patent applications for:\no A single measles vaccine\no A treatment for inflammatory bowel disease, and\no A treatment for autism\n Members of Wakefield's research team often spoke giddily of the Nobel Prize they would win\nand Wakefield himself aspired to be the greatest gastroenterologist ever.\nWakefield had previously formed companies (1991, 1993, 1994) to commercially exploit his scientific\ndiscoveries, but none had succeeded. Nonetheless, soon after publication of The Lancet article,\nWakefield met with potential investors to form a company to sell products (e.g., an alternative measles\nvaccine) that he planned to develop in this area. His projections for revenue and profit potential were\naggressively optimistic, depending largely on Barr's litigation succeeding. He negotiated to give the\nschool a piece of his projected action in return for certain benefits, including a title for himself as\nprofessor. The school refused to give Wakefield that title.\nIn October of 1998, Barr filed the first court claims. Wakefield was to be Barr's primary expert witness\nand pretended to be an independent scientist. In 1999, when shortcomings in Wakefield's study came\nto light (very small number of subjects, subjects not chosen randomly, no comparison group of non-\nautistic children, heavy reliance on parents' memories and beliefs, etc.), his university asked him to\nreplicate his research results with a gold standard scientific study. Wakefield readily agreed to do so,\nbut never even began such a study. Ultimately, he refused additional replication requests.\nIn 2000, Wakefield testified in Washington D.C. before a congressional committee regarding the\ndangers of the MMR vaccine. Another witness was John O'Leary, an Irish pathologist. Neither disclosed\nthat they were business partners nor that O'Leary was also being supported financially by lawyer Barr.\nBy October 2003, the flaws in Wakefield's study were sufficiently apparent that Barr's MMR lawsuit\nwas dismissed for lack of evidence. The government money stopped flowing, but Barr and his staff had\nalready received $51m in current U.S. dollars and Wakefield had received $846,000 in today's dollars,\nplus expenses (roughly eight times his medical school salary).\nSoon thereafter, journalist Brian Deer -- whose book The Doctor Who Fooled the World provides\nvirtually all the material for this case study -- began thoroughly investigating Wakefield and his\nresearch. As litigation involving Wakefield and his colleagues proceeded, documents related to\nWakefield's study in The Lancet came to light, showing that the article inaccurately described the\nconditions of every single one of the twelve subjects. Some were described as having autism when\nmedical records showed that they did not. Some were described as having Crohn's disease, when\nmedical records showed that they did not. Others were described as having developed autism soon\nCase Study - Birthing Vaccine Skepticism - Page 2 of 7\nafter having received the MMR vaccine, while medical records showed that they had manifested signs\nof autism before being vaccinated. And so on.\nAlthough the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals clearly require\nthat third-party funding and expert witness work must be disclosed as conflicts of interest, Wakefield\nsaid that he did not agree. On May 3, 2004, 10 of 12 co-authors on The Lancet article repudiated the\npaper's conclusions. Ultimately, after a long hearing, the General Medical Council canceled Wakefield's\nmedical registration.\nNone of this prevented Wakefield from becoming the darling of the anti-vaccine set and creating\nsignificant vaccine hesitancy regarding the MMR vaccine (and others). The result has been a rise in\nmeasles deaths around the world. As of 2022, Wakefield maintains his discredited theory and paints\nhimself as the victim in all this.\nCase Study - Birthing Vaccine Skepticism - Page 3 of 7",

        "3. The Ethics Unwrapped video on the self-serving bias points out that because of this bias, people have a tendency to gather, process, and even remember information in ways that advance their self-interest and support their pre-existing views. What facts in the case study might cause Andrew Wakefield to be impacted by the self-serving bias?",
        "4. As mentioned, the self-serving bias inclines people to process information in a self-serving way. One relevant influence is the confirmation bias, which is the tendency of people's minds to seek out information that supports views they already hold and to interpret evidence in ways that support those views. The Ethics Unwrapped video on the confirmation bias gives this example: when physicians have an idea about a patient's diagnosis, they may focus on evidence that supports their theory while undervaluing evidence that supports an equally plausible alternative diagnosis. Do you see evidence of the confirmation bias in the facts spelled out in the case study? Explain.",
        "5. Nick Chadwick was a researcher on Wakefield's team. When Chadwick applied tests the team had developed for amplifying measles DNA, he was unable to find the virus where Wakefield's theories indicated it should be found. This did not please Wakefield. As Chadwick said: He tended to believe, you know, positive data that fitted with his hypothesis and then disregard the negative data. Does this quotation provide evidence that Wakefield was affected by the confirmation bias? Explain. Consider these quotations from Deer's book: a. Wakefield's mother said: He's very like my father. If he believed in something, he would have gone to the ends of the earth to go on believing. b. John March, a veterinary vaccine specialist who was part of Barr's team to analyze the evidence, found that there was no viable legal case. March said that he was asked to sign a confidentiality agreement to ensure that the evidence would never be published, adding: It was almost like it had become a religion. And if you got a result that you didn't like, you ignored that result and carried on. c. Scientist Hugh Fudenberg turned away Wakefield's attempt to form a joint business, later saying that he didn't like Wakefield's priorities: He wanted to prove he was right. That was his main motive. To prove he was right. He kept at it through thick and thin. He was about just money too much.",
        "6. In one study of the confirmation bias done by Professors Ditto and Lopez, subjects were given a strip of paper and told they could use it to test to see whether they had a particular fictitious Case Study - Birthing Vaccine Skepticism - Page 4 of 7 medical condition. Some subjects were told that if they put their saliva on the paper and it did not change color, then they did not have the condition (which portended pancreatic issues later in life). These people generally would touch the paper to their saliva, see that it didn't change color (because, unknown to them, it was just a strip of plain yellow construction paper) and go on their way happy with the result. Other subjects were told that if they touched the paper to their saliva and it did not change color, that meant that they did have the unfortunate condition. These subjects tended to touch the paper to their saliva, see that it didn't change color and then, not being happy with this result, would typically touch the paper to their saliva several more times, hoping for a different result. In the course of your work (maybe as a researcher, maybe in another role) you may face a situation where a particular outcome of an experiment (or a program or a plan) will be a good development for your career. How will you guard against a subconscious desire to interpret ambiguous evidence in a one-sided manner that benefits you?",
        "7. What special qualities might immunize you from the self-serving bias? Does this buffer seem a realistic one to you? Explain.",
        "8. Wakefield had visions of a Nobel Prize and a dream of being the world's leading gastroenterologist. Yet, as Brian Deer points out, as Wakefield started his infamous study that was ultimately published in The Lancet: ...he'd been nobody: a doctor without patients at a third-rate London hospital and medical school. He'd been a laboratory gastroenterologist, a former trainee gut surgeon, most relevantly defined by what he wasn't. He wasn't a virologist, immunologist, or epidemiologist. He wasn't a neurologist, psychologist, or psychiatrist. He wasn't a pediatrician or clinician. How might the overconfidence bias have played a role in the chaos that Wakefield created with his study? How does that square with what Deer says about Wakefield above? Explain.",
        "9. Cain, Loewenstein, and Moore hypothesized that disclosure of conflicts of interest could worsen rather than improve financial advisors' performance in two ways. First, while having to disclose conflicts of interest might incentivize financial advisors to consciously try to improve the accuracy of their recommendations, they might also be tempted to provide even more biased advice knowing that their clients would perhaps discount their advice somewhat due to the disclosure of the conflict (this is called strategic exaggeration). Second, after doing a good thing (disclosing conflicts of interest), financial advisors might unconsciously grant themselves permission to lower their normal standards by providing even more biased advice (this is called moral licensing). Cain and colleagues tested their theory experimentally and found just such a result. If you are a researcher, describe how you will guard against strategic exaggeration and moral licensing after you disclose your conflicts of interest. If you are in another role (in your career or as a student), how might strategic exaggeration and moral licensing impact you?",
        "10. How might researchers who wrongly, but perhaps sincerely, believe that they are on the trail of the true cause of the recent rise in autism diagnoses give themselves moral license to stretch Case Study - Birthing Vaccine Skepticism - Page 5 of 7 the truth and to relax research protocols in order to convince the world of the accuracy of their findings that they so strongly believe? What rationalizations might these researchers use to justify their actions?",
        "11. Once Wakefield had held a couple of press conferences announcing that his findings supported the theory he was touting, would it have been difficult for him to later admit error? Deer thought so. Do you agree with the implications of his statement below? Explain. [Wakefield] was being paid at hourly rates to advance his syndrome in Barr's lawsuit. If he didn't find fault with the solicitor's target product, his lavish personal fees would stop. He'd filed for two patents claiming single measles shots. And, with [his mentor Dr. Roy] Pounder, he already announced to the world, in Pulse [a magazine for doctors], evidence that confirm our suspicions.",
        "12. People can be unconsciously impacted by factors such as the self-serving bias, the confirmation bias, the overconfidence bias, and the like. But sometimes, wrongdoing can be conscious and intentional. Which is it with Wakefield? Do you believe Wakefield was influenced by subtle psychological factors (as well all are), or do you think his actions were more intentional? Consider the comments below, and support your reasoning. a. The Lancet's editorial board concluded: Who perpetrated this fraud? There is no doubt that it was Wakefield. Is it possible that he was wrong, but not dishonest: that he was so incompetent that he was unable to fairly describe the project, or to report even one of the 12 children's cases accurately? No. A great deal of thought and effort must have gone into drafting the paper to achieve the results he wanted: the discrepancies all led in one direction; misreporting was gross. b. And journalist Brian Deer, who found Wakefield to be incapable of embarrassment and possessing no conscience.",
        "13. How could Wakefield have possibly believed that the disclosure rules of the Uniform Requirements did not apply to him? How could he have not joined ten of his eleven co-authors in retracting the article in The Lancet? Are these decisions indications that he is an intentional fraud, or that he is just more susceptible to these various biases than most of the rest of us? Explain.

      "title": "Wells-Fargo_Moral-Emotions-Case-Study_English",
      "content": "Wells Fargo and Moral Emotions\nOn September 8, 2016, Wells Fargo, one of the nation's oldest and largest banks, admitted in a\nsettlement with regulators that it had created as many as two million accounts for customers without\ntheir permission. This was fraud, pure and simple. It seems to have been caused by a culture in the\nbank that made unreasonable demands upon employees. Wells Fargo agreed to pay $185 million in\nfines and penalties.\nEmployees had been urged to cross-sell. If a customer had one type of account with Wells Fargo,\nthen top brass reasoned, they should have several. Employees were strongly incentivized, through\nboth positive and negative means, to sell as many different types of accounts to customers as possible.\nEight is great was a motto. But does the average person need eight financial products from a single\nbank? As things developed, when employees were unable to make such sales, they just made the\naccounts up and charged customers whether they had approved the accounts or not. The employees\nused customers' personal identification numbers without their knowledge to enroll them in various\nproducts without their knowledge. Victims were frequently elderly or Spanish speakers.\nMatthew Castro, whose father was born in Colombia, felt so bad about pushing sham accounts onto\nLatino customers than he tried to lessen his guilt by doing volunteer work. Other employees were\nquoted as saying it's beyond embarrassing to admit I am a current employee these days.\nStill other employees were moved to call company hotlines or otherwise blow the whistle, but they\nwere simply ignored or oftentimes punished, frequently by being fired. One employee who sued to\nchallenge retaliation against him was uncomfortable and unsettled by the practices he saw around\nhim, which prompted him to speak out. This is a fraud, I cannot be a part of that, the whistleblower\nsaid.\nEarly prognostications were that CEO John Stumpf would not lose his job over the fiasco. However, as\ntime went on and investigations continued, the forms and amount of wrongdoing seemed to grow and\ngrow. Evidence surfaced that the bank improperly changed the terms of mortgage loans, signed\ncustomers up for unauthorized life insurance policies, overcharged small businesses for credit-card\nprocessing, and on and on.\nIn September of 2016, CEO Stumpf appeared\nbefore Congress and was savaged by Senators and\nRepresentatives of both parties, notwithstanding\nhis agreement to forfeit $41 million in pay. The\nmembers of Congress denounced Wells Fargo's\nactions as theft, a criminal enterprise, and an\noutrage. Stumpf simultaneously took full\nCase Study - Wells Fargo and Moral Emotions - Page 1 of 4\nresponsibility, yet blamed the fraud on ethical lapses of low-level bankers and tellers. He had, he said,\nled the company with courage. Nonetheless, by October of 2016 Stumpf had been forced into\nretirement and replaced by Tim Sloan.\nOver the next several months, more and more allegations of wrongdoing arose. The bank had illegally\nrepossessed cars from military veterans. It had modified mortgages without customer authorization.\nIt had charged 570,000 customers for auto insurance they did not need. It had ripped off small\nbusinesses by charging excessive credit card fees. The total number of fake accounts rose from two\nmillion to 3.5 million. The bank also wrongly fined 110,000 mortgage clients for missing a deadline\neven though the party at fault for the delay was Wells Fargo itself.\nAt its April 2017 annual shareholders meeting, the firm faced levels of dissent that a Georgetown\nbusiness school professor, Sandeep Dahiya, called highly unusual.\nBy September, 2017, Wells Fargo had paid $414 million in refunds and settlements and incurred\nhundreds of millions more in attorneys' and other fees. This included $108 million paid to the\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs for having overcharged military veterans on mortgage refinancing.\nIn October 2017, new Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan was told by Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren,\na Democrat, that he should be fired: You enabled this fake-account scandal. You got rich off it, and\nthen you tried to cover it up. Republicans were equally harsh. Senator John Kennedy Texas said: I'm\nnot against big. With all due respect, I'm against dumb.\nSloan was still CEO when the company had its annual shareholders meeting in April 2018. Shareholder\nand protestors were both extremely angry with Wells Fargo. By then, the bank had paid an additional\n$1 billion fine for abuses in mortgage and auto lending. And, in an unprecedented move, the Federal\nReserve Board had ordered the bank to cap its asset growth. Disgust with Wells Fargo's practices\ncaused the American Federation of Teachers, to cut ties with the bank. Some whistleblowers resisted\nearly attempts at quiet settlements with the bank, holding out for a public admission of wrongdoing.\nIn May 2018, yet another shoe dropped. Wells Fargo's share price dropped on news that the bank's\nemployees improperly altered documents of its corporate customers in an attempt to comply with\nregulatory directions related to money laundering rules.\nUltimately, Wells Fargo removed its cross-selling sales incentives. CEO Sloan, having been informed\nthat lower level employees were suffering stress, panic attacks, and other symptoms apologized for the\nfact that management initially blamed them for the results of the toxic corporate culture, admitting\nthat cultural weaknesses had caused a major morale problem.\nCase Study - Wells Fargo and Moral Emotions - Page 2 of 4",
      "questions": [
        "1. What moral emotions seem to have been at play in this case? On the part of the bank's employees? The bank's victims? The bank's regulators? The bank's shareholders?",
        "2. What factors contributed particularly to the outrage and anger that legislators, regulators, customers, and shareholders felt?",
        "3. Clearly inner-directed emotions such as guilt and embarrassment affected the actions of Wells Fargo employees. Were they always sufficient to overcome the employees' utilitarian calculation: I need this job?",
        "4. Did moral emotions motivate some of the whistleblowers? How?",
        "5. In the wake of everything described in the case study, Wells Fargo has fired many employees, clawed back bonuses from executives, replaced many of its directors, dismantled its sales incentive system and made other changes. Do you think these changes were made out of a utilitarian calculation designed to avoid further monetary penalties, a desire to avoid the shame and embarrassment the bank's managers and employees were feeling, or a combination of both? If a combination, which do you think played a bigger role? Why?
