Discussion Questions:

1. Beyond green consumption, what other types of products might bring about similar kinds of
moral licensing effects? Can you think of instances in your own life when your purchase choices
have licensed you to make decisions that were less than ethically ideal? Explain.

2. Do you think these moral licensing effects are common across all kinds of green consumers? Or
are there other factors (i.e. demographics, psychographics) that might either exacerbate or
weaken the effects? Why or why not?

3. The authors of the study, Mazar and Zhong, initially thought green consumption would have a
positive spillover effect and encourage positive behaviors. Why do you think they found the
opposite?

4. What steps do you think can be taken to help minimize or mitigate these types of moral
licensing effects among green consumers? Explain.

5. If you were the brand manager for a green product, for example an organic food item or an
energy-efficient appliance, how would you go about marketing the product knowing these
licensing effects were possible?
