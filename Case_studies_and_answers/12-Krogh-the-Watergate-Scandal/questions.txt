Discussion Questions:

1. How was ethical fading a part of Egil Krogh’s eventual journey to prison? Explain.

2. At the time the decision was made, what factors caused the morality of the decision to break
into the office of Ellsberg’s psychiatrist to fade from view?

3. Krogh has said that he went into his White House job “with tremendous enthusiasm and
commitment—almost to a fault.” Do you think this is reflective of his actions in the Nixon
administration? Why or why not?

4. In what ways did authority figures affect Krogh’s actions? Explain.

5. How might one guard against ethical fading in a high-pressure work environment?

6. Krogh believes that the Bush administration’s policies and practices regarding torture during
the Iraq War reflect the same types of decision-making errors that he was guilty of regarding
the plumbers’ operations. Do you agree? Why or why not?
