1. Ethical fading occurred as Krogh became so focused on operational details and loyalty to Nixon's administration that he failed to evaluate whether the break-in was legal or moral. He rationalized his actions as serving national security, obscuring the ethical implications of his decisions.

2. Factors contributing to the fading of morality included a sense of urgency to address a perceived national security threat, pressure from authority figures like Nixon and Ehrlichman, and the normalization of covert operations in the political environment. Krogh’s focus on loyalty and task completion overrode his ethical considerations.

3. Krogh’s enthusiasm and commitment seem reflective of his actions. His zeal to serve the administration led him to prioritize loyalty and results over ethical boundaries. His willingness to follow orders without questioning their legality or morality supports this reflection.

4. Authority figures, particularly Nixon and Ehrlichman, heavily influenced Krogh’s actions by framing the break-in as a matter of national security. The hierarchical structure of the administration and the implicit expectation to obey directives without question amplified Krogh’s susceptibility to ethical fading.

5. Guarding against ethical fading requires fostering a culture of open dialogue about ethics, establishing clear guidelines for decision-making, and encouraging individuals to question directives that may conflict with legal or moral standards. Personal integrity and accountability should be emphasized.

6. Krogh’s comparison to the Bush administration’s policies on torture is valid to some extent, as both involved decisions justified by perceived threats to national security while ignoring legal and ethical boundaries. Both cases reflect failures in moral reasoning, where the ends were used to justify unethical means. However, the broader political and situational contexts may lead to nuanced differences in the comparison.
