1. Yes, the United States has a moral obligation to accept migrants, particularly those fleeing violence, poverty, or persecution. The impetus for migration does matter; economic migrants may be fleeing hardship, but political asylum-seekers fleeing violence or persecution often face more immediate and severe risks. Both groups deserve empathy and legal protection, though the methods for managing their claims may differ depending on the nature of their circumstances.

2. The values in conflict include compassion for vulnerable people, the economic burden of supporting migrants, national security concerns, and the importance of maintaining law and order in immigration policies. There is also tension between protecting human rights and managing limited resources.

3. Yes, the U.S. has a special moral obligation to receive child migrants. Children, especially unaccompanied minors, are particularly vulnerable and often escape life-threatening violence or abuse. As a wealthy nation, the U.S. has a greater ability to protect and care for vulnerable children compared to the countries from which they are fleeing.

4. There are limits to the moral obligation of accepting migrants, particularly if the influx threatens to overwhelm a nation's capacity for integration, security, and resources. However, this doesn't mean that nations should reject migrants outright but should find ways to balance compassion with the practical realities of immigration and resettlement. Ethical responsibility requires a thoughtful and measured response.

5. Immigration policies should prioritize the protection of vulnerable migrants, including children, while also addressing concerns about incentives for dangerous migration. Policies could include temporary protection status for minors, improved refugee processing systems, and stronger international collaboration to address root causes of migration such as violence and poverty.

6. Yes, the U.S. has a moral obligation to help resolve the deeper reasons for mass migration, particularly if American policies have contributed to these issues. Addressing the root causes of migration, such as economic inequality and the drug trade, would reduce the push factors that lead people to migrate, benefiting both the migrants and the countries they come from.

7. The methods used to limit migration by intercepting children and forcing them to return to dangerous situations were not ethically justifiable. Children fleeing violence should be afforded legal protection and opportunities for asylum, rather than being returned to situations that may pose a life-threatening risk. The international community and the U.S. should work towards humane alternatives.
