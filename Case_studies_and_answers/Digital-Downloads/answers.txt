1. The harms of piracy outweigh the benefits. While piracy can offer exposure and access to music, it undermines the financial viability of the music industry and deprives artists of compensation for their work. Artists rely on income from their music to fund their careers, and piracy disrupts this income, which can harm both established and emerging musicians.

2. Napster's illegal activities should not be justified solely by the positive outcomes. While Napster did stimulate innovations like iTunes and Pandora, it violated copyright laws and deprived artists and producers of compensation. The long-term consequences of undermining copyright protection can be damaging to creators and industries, making illegal activities harder to justify, even with positive results.

3. If Apple had not agreed to compensate artists, subscribing to their service would be ethically questionable. Supporting a service that profits off artists' work without compensating them undermines fair compensation for creators. Apple’s response to Swift’s letter showed a commitment to fair compensation, and this made me more likely to subscribe, as it aligns with supporting artists’ rights and fair business practices.

4. Piracy violates the moral rule of “do not harm others.” In addition to artists, piracy affects producers, record companies, and the broader music industry, which relies on income from sales and streaming. It can also impact workers in industries related to music distribution, like technicians, marketers, and concert organizers. Taking a broader view of the people affected and the harm caused strengthens the argument that piracy is unethical, as it extends beyond the artists to the entire music ecosystem.
