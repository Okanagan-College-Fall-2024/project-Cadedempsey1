Discussion Questions:

1.	In what ways is self-­‐serving bias apparent in this case regarding James Frey? Regarding Oprah Winfrey? Do you think one’s position is more ethically defensible than the other’s? Why or why not?
2.	Do you believe authors should adhere only to fact in memoirs? Why or why not? Do you think authors have a responsibility to tell the truth to their audiences? Explain.
3.	Cultural critic Laura Kipnis writes, “If Frey, an aspiring novelist, harnessed himself to the engine of the recovery narrative to get his story into print, his readers compromised themselves too, swallowing his writerly affectations like pills mashed up in applesauce, so eager for a fix of recovery lit that the eye-­‐blinking grandiosities [of the book] barely registered.” Do you agree with this statement? Why or why not?

4.	Do you know people who seem to remember past events in their lives in ways that put themselves in a very favorable light? Do you have this tendency? Explain with examples.

5.	Can you think of other examples in politics, newspapers, business, or your everyday life that seem to illustrate the impact of the self-­‐serving bias? Explain with examples.
