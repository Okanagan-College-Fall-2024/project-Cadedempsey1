Discussion Questions:
1.	In trying to teach the student a lesson about taking responsibility for her actions, did the teacher go too far and become a bully? Why or why not? Does she deserve to be fired for her actions?

2.	What punishment does the student deserve? Why?
3.	Who is the victim in this case? The teacher or the student? Was one victimized more than the other? Explain.

4.	Do victims have the right to defend themselves against bullies? What if they go through the proper channels to report bullying and it doesn’t stop?
5.	How should compassion play a role in judging other’s actions?

6.	How are factors like age and gender used to “excuse” unethical behavior? (ie. “Boys will be boys” or “She’s too young/old to understand that what she did is wrong”) Can you think of any other factors that are sometimes used to excuse unethical behavior?
7.	How is cyberbullying similar or different from face-­‐to-­‐face bullying? Is one more harmful than the other? Explain.
