1. Obedience to authority played a significant role in Franz Stangl's perception of his responsibility. He believed that by following orders, he was merely doing his duty, thus absolving himself of personal responsibility for the murders. This mindset suggests that Stangl viewed his actions through the lens of duty and obedience, prioritizing compliance with orders over the moral implications of his actions. Other factors influencing his perception may include the dehumanizing environment of Nazi ideology, social pressures to conform, and the psychological distancing from the victims through bureaucratic roles, which allowed him to avoid confronting the reality of what he was facilitating.

2. Stangl's description of his guilt while in prison suggests that he did not fully believe his claims in court. While he maintained that he never personally murdered anyone and was simply doing his job, his later statement, "I was there... so yes, in reality I share the guilt," indicates that he recognized his role in the atrocities. His conscience was conflicted; despite his earlier defenses, the gravity of his actions seemed to have weighed on him by the time of his prison interview, suggesting that he may have realized the moral implications of his behavior.

3. What might have helped Stangl see his actions more clearly is a greater sense of empathy, an understanding of the broader consequences of his role in the Holocaust, and a willingness to confront the ethical violations of the Nazi regime. If he had been exposed to alternative perspectives, such as those from victims or other resistance figures, it could have shaken his belief in the righteousness of his actions. However, whether this would have led to different behavior is debatable; the environment he operated in, characterized by ideological extremism and a rigid bureaucratic structure, likely made it extremely difficult to acknowledge the moral implications of his actions.

4. Historical examples of obedience to authority influencing actions include the My Lai Massacre during the Vietnam War, where American soldiers followed orders to kill civilians, and the Stanford Prison Experiment, in which participants, playing the role of guards, became abusive to prisoners. In both cases, individuals conformed to authority figures, which led to morally reprehensible actions. These examples show that authority can overpower personal ethics, especially when individuals are conditioned to see their actions as part of a larger, unquestionable system.

5. In a bureaucracy, an individual's moral responsibility should still exist, but it is often diffused across multiple layers of authority and decision-making. However, individuals still have the capacity to challenge orders and question the morality of their actions. While systemic structures can influence behavior, personal ethical responsibility remains critical, and individuals must maintain their moral compass, especially in situations that violate human rights or ethical standards.

6. One's position in a hierarchy can affect moral responsibility, but it does not absolve individuals from accountability. Higher-ranking individuals may have more control over decisions, while those in lower positions might feel pressured to comply with orders. However, all individuals within a hierarchy retain moral responsibility, as they are capable of questioning orders and considering the ethical implications of their actions. The argument that "I was just following orders" does not diminish an individual's accountability, particularly when actions involve harming others.
