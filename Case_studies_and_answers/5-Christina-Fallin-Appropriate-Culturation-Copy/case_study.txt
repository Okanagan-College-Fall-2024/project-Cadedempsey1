Christina Fallin: “Appropriate Culturation?” 
 
In March 2014, twenty-seven year old Christina Fallin, daughter of Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin, 
found herself at the center of controversy when she posted an image of herself wearing a red Plains 
headdress on Facebook and Instagram with the tag “Appropriate Culturation.” Fallin posed for this 
photo as a promotional piece for her band, Pink Pony. Public outcry criticized Fallin for appropriating 
Native American cultures, sparking uproar on social media and leading to protests at their shows. 
 
In response, Fallin and Pink Pony removed the photo and released a statement on their Facebook page 
explaining their aesthetic appreciation for Native American culture. Fallin told the Indian Country 
Today Media Network that, “I think Native American culture is the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen, 
so I was naturally drawn to it.” Musician Wayne Coyne of The Flaming Lips became involved in the 
issue when he fired bandmate Kliph Scurlock for criticizing Fallin online. To show his support for Fallin, 
Coyne posted Instagram photos of several friends and a dog wearing headdresses. 
 
Some argue that Fallin’s photo could be an example of artistic appropriation. Throughout history, 
artists have borrowed objects and images from everyday life as well as other cultures in order to re-
contextualize the object in a new manner. On the other hand, some argue that non-Native Americans 
do not have the right to adorn a headdress at all. Taking a sacred or meaningful object out of context is 
problematic even when touted as “art.” Summer Morgan, member of the Kiowa tribe in Oklahoma, 
believes that Fallin may have had good intentions, but there are better ways to express her 
appreciation of Native American cultures. Morgan believes 
that headdresses are not fashion accessories. Following 
Kiowa tradition, only men can own war bonnets and each 
feather represents a war deed. Female relatives may be given 
the right to wear a male relative’s war bonnet, but only after 
they understand what’s expected of them when they wear it, 
how to treat it properly, and when it is acceptable to wear.
