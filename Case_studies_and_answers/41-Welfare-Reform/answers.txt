1. Those who favor the individualistic fundamental moral unit include the supporters of the Welfare Reform Act, such as Republican Speaker Newt Gingrich, who argued that reducing welfare funding reinforces values like individual responsibility, hard work, and independence. Those who favor the community-oriented moral unit include critics like Peter Edelman and Senator Edward Kennedy, who believed the government should care for disadvantaged people. The viewpoint I find most compelling is the community-oriented moral unit, as systemic issues often create barriers that individuals cannot overcome alone.

2. Yes, governments or societies do have an obligation to care for disadvantaged or lower-income families. Providing support helps break cycles of poverty, ensures basic human dignity, and promotes equality. A communityâ€™s well-being often hinges on the health and stability of its most vulnerable members, and society shares in the responsibility to foster a compassionate safety net.

3. Not everyone in my home country has equal opportunities to succeed in society. There are barriers such as economic background, education quality, and discrimination that hinder access to equal opportunities. Success should not be seen as solely the responsibility of the individual, as structural inequalities play a significant role. Government policies and initiatives that address these disparities can help create a more level playing field.

4. Individuals raised with a focus on individual responsibility might view the Welfare Reform Act more favorably, seeing it as a means to encourage self-reliance and hard work. Those raised with a community-oriented perspective might view it negatively, perceiving it as abandoning vulnerable populations and undermining social safety nets. The fundamental moral unit shapes their views on the role of the government in addressing poverty.

5. Awareness of the fundamental moral unit helps us better understand the differences between political parties by highlighting how parties prioritize values. Individualistic perspectives tend to favor personal responsibility, self-reliance, and limited government intervention, while community-oriented views emphasize collective responsibility, social welfare, and government support for the disadvantaged. These differing priorities lead to distinct political ideologies and policy preferences.
