1. The moral emotions evident in the case include guilt and embarrassment among the bank's employees, especially those who recognized their participation in unethical practices. Victims likely experienced feelings of betrayal and anger. Regulators seemed motivated by outrage at the extent of fraud and the harm caused, while shareholders expressed frustration and dismay at the impact on the bank's reputation and value.

2. Factors contributing to the outrage and anger include the sheer scale of the fraudulent activity, the exploitation of vulnerable populations (e.g., elderly and Spanish speakers), the retaliation against whistleblowers, and the repeated emergence of new misconduct. Legislators and regulators were incensed by the bank's attempts to shift blame and minimize accountability.

3. Inner-directed emotions such as guilt and embarrassment were significant for some employees, as evidenced by actions like volunteering to mitigate guilt or whistleblowing. However, these emotions were not always sufficient to overcome the utilitarian calculation of needing to keep their jobs, as many employees continued to participate in unethical practices under pressure.

4. Yes, moral emotions motivated some whistleblowers. Feelings of discomfort, guilt, and being "unsettled" by the unethical practices compelled them to act, even at personal risk. For example, one whistleblower stated, "This is a fraud, I cannot be a part of that," demonstrating a moral conviction to expose wrongdoing.

5. The changes Wells Fargo made likely stemmed from a combination of utilitarian calculation and a desire to avoid shame and embarrassment. The need to prevent further monetary penalties and legal actions likely played a bigger role, as evidenced by the extensive financial settlements and reforms. However, the acknowledgment of a toxic corporate culture and its impact on employees suggests an awareness of the moral and emotional dimensions as well.
