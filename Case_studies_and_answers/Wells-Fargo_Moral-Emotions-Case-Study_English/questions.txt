1. What moral emotions seem to have been at play in this case? On the part of the bank’s
employees? The bank’s victims? The bank’s regulators? The bank’s shareholders?
2. What factors contributed particularly to the outrage and anger that legislators, regulators,
customers, and shareholders felt?
3. Clearly inner-directed emotions such as guilt and embarrassment affected the actions of Wells
Fargo employees. Were they always sufficient to overcome the employees’ utilitarian
calculation: “I need this job”?
4. Did moral emotions motivate some of the whistleblowers? How?
5. In the wake of everything described in the case study, Wells Fargo has fired many employees,
clawed back bonuses from executives, replaced many of its directors, dismantled its sales
incentive system and made other changes. Do you think these changes were made out of a
utilitarian calculation designed to avoid further monetary penalties, a desire to avoid the shame
and embarrassment the bank’s managers and employees were feeling, or a combination of
both? If a combination, which do you think played a bigger role? Why?
