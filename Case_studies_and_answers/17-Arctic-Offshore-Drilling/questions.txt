Discussion Questions:

1. Do you find one framing of the situation more compelling than the other? Why? In what ways do
your own beliefs or opinions affect your perspective on this issue?

2. If you were in President Obama’s position, how might the different ways of framing this issue affect
your decision-making process? Is it possible to make an objective decision in the case of Arctic
drilling? How might you come to a decision that is both reasonable and ethically defensible?

3. Can you think of other ethical dilemmas that are unexplored or absent in these dominant,
competing frames of offshore drilling? How might these additional issues affect the decision to drill
in the Arctic?

4. Do you think there are unintended or undesirable consequences of framing Arctic drilling as an
“either-or” issue, i.e. as one that pits environmentalists against business leaders? Why or why not?

5. Can you think of an example of another contentious issue that has been framed in an “either-or”
way? What would be an ethically ideal way to resolve this issue and why?
