1. **Pao's choice to voice her values**: Pao voiced her values at several critical points during her time at Kleiner Perkins. First, she wrote the formal memorandum in January 2012, which outlined her experiences of gender discrimination, harassment, and exclusion. This action demonstrated her commitment to fairness and equal treatment for women in the workplace. She also voiced her values in the lawsuit by bringing attention to the broader issue of gender inequality in the venture capital industry and tech sector, despite potential personal risks. In both cases, Pao stood up for what she believed was a moral and just cause, seeking to create a more equitable workplace environment.

2. **Did Pao act effectively on her values?**: Pao’s actions were effective in bringing attention to the systemic issues of gender discrimination in Silicon Valley, even though she lost the lawsuit. Her public stance helped shine a spotlight on the gender imbalance in the venture capital sector and prompted wider conversations about the treatment of women in tech. While her legal case did not succeed, the ripple effect of her actions led to more awareness and inspired others to pursue similar claims. Therefore, while the outcome might not have been what Pao had hoped, her actions still had a meaningful impact in raising awareness and sparking change.

3. **The Seven Pillars of GVV in Pao's actions**:
   - **Choice**: Pao made a conscious decision to speak out against the discrimination she faced and to file a lawsuit.
   - **Normalization**: She made gender discrimination and retaliation a matter of public concern, which helped normalize these issues as topics for discussion within the tech industry.
   - **Resources**: Pao sought out resources by talking to her superiors and legal counsel, taking steps to address the issue within the organization before pursuing legal action.
   - **Reasoning**: Pao’s reasoning was based on the belief in equal opportunities and the need for systemic change, which she articulated in her memo and lawsuit.
   - **Relationships**: Her action caused strain with her colleagues and employer, but it reflected her prioritization of ethical treatment over career advancement.
   - **Self-Knowledge**: Pao demonstrated self-awareness by recognizing her desire for change, even at the cost of her career. She understood the potential risks involved in her actions.
   - **Voice**: By publicly filing the lawsuit, Pao amplified her voice and made her concerns known, despite the challenges she faced.

   **Engagement**: Pao could have perhaps engaged more with external support systems or alliances within the industry to strengthen her position. Forming a broader coalition of women in the field might have given her more leverage in confronting these issues earlier.

4. **If I were in Pao’s position**: In Pao's position, I would have likely done something similar by voicing concerns through formal channels, like the memorandum, to create a record of the issues faced. However, I might also have explored external support options earlier, such as reaching out to women’s advocacy groups or allies in the tech industry. The **pillar of "Voice"** would be critical in this situation: I would seek to ensure that my concerns are heard by the broader organization and, if necessary, make those concerns public. By maintaining a clear, consistent voice, I would hope to create a stronger sense of accountability within the organization.

5. **If I were a juror**: As a juror, I would be conflicted, but I might lean toward ruling in favor of Pao due to the nature of the allegations and the evidence of systemic issues that she described, such as exclusion from meetings and inappropriate behavior from senior partners. However, I would also carefully consider the performance reviews and the defense's arguments. My decision would be influenced by a combination of legal facts and my values around fairness, equal opportunity, and addressing power imbalances in the workplace.

6. **Ethically questionable behavior at work**: In a past job where I faced ethically questionable behavior, I reported the issue to HR and spoke up to a supervisor. Looking back, I wish I had kept more detailed documentation of the behavior to support my claims. Today, I would approach the situation more strategically, ensuring that I understand both the internal resources and external avenues available to address the issue, including advocacy groups and legal counsel if necessary.

7. **Witnessing or experiencing discrimination**: If I had witnessed or experienced discrimination in the workplace, I would try to document the incidents and report them to HR or a higher authority. The ethically ideal way to handle such instances is to create a safe and supportive environment where individuals feel empowered to speak up and hold the organization accountable for its actions. Ideally, discrimination should be confronted as soon as it is identified, with clear policies in place to protect employees from retaliation and to foster an inclusive workplace.
