1. The United States may not be ethically required to respond to every epidemic and health crisis in foreign countries, but as a global leader, it has a moral obligation to assist in cases where its resources and influence can make a significant difference in preventing widespread suffering and global instability. This obligation is rooted in the principles of humanitarian aid and global health security.

2. The historical colonial ties between the U.K., France, and the U.S. and the countries affected by the Ebola outbreak may have influenced the relief efforts, but there is no ethical justification for concentrating aid based on colonial history alone. Imperialist nations may have a particular responsibility to assist former colonies, but this duty should be framed in terms of global solidarity and mutual benefit, not merely due to past relationships.

3. It is ethically permissible to deploy the U.S. military in humanitarian relief efforts if the goal is to provide essential aid in a crisis situation and the military’s resources and expertise are the most effective option available. The potential benefits include rapid deployment, effective logistical support, and the ability to build necessary infrastructure. However, the potential harms include the militarization of humanitarian efforts, loss of neutrality, and the risk of prioritizing security over health care needs.

4. President Obama’s response to the Ebola epidemic was arguably sufficient, given the scale of the crisis and the logistical challenges involved. If I were in his position, I would have focused on providing medical and logistical support quickly while avoiding over-reliance on military personnel for non-security tasks. The key would be to ensure that health experts, like those from the WHO and NGOs, played a central role in managing the crisis.

5. The fact that many of the American-built treatment facilities were underutilized does not significantly affect my judgment of President Obama’s response, as the military’s role was to rapidly set up infrastructure and provide logistical support. The overall reduction in Ebola cases can be attributed to a combination of factors, and the intervention may have still played a vital role in creating an environment for containment.
