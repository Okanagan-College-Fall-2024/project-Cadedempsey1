1. The potential conflicts of interest in this case study primarily arise from the media’s involvement in voting for the BCS rankings. Journalists, who are meant to cover news impartially, also have a direct hand in shaping the outcomes of college football, which could influence financial rewards and media contracts. The more media exposure a conference or team gets, the larger the financial gain from broadcasts and sponsorships. This potential for bias and the intersection of financial interests could lead journalists to act in a way that is not objective or fair. The concerns are compelling because they highlight how these conflicts could undermine the credibility and impartiality of the rankings system.

2. Journalists should be impartial observers in determining BCS rankings. Their primary role should be to report accurately on the games and teams, rather than actively participating in shaping the rankings. However, if journalists do participate in rankings, it must be with full transparency, accountability, and a clear distinction between reporting and ranking roles. Ethical participation would require clear boundaries, such as independent oversight and ensuring that journalists are not benefiting directly from their voting power or influencing the financial outcomes for conferences.

3. The Harris poll may address some of the ethical concerns that plagued the AP poll by making the ballots public, which promotes transparency. By involving media members and market research experts in the poll and promoting openness about the rankings, it mitigates the risk of behind-the-scenes influence. However, some concerns may still persist, particularly in the structure of the poll and how it still relies on subjective opinions. While more transparent, the Harris poll does not entirely eliminate the potential for conflicts of interest or biased decisions.

4. The Harris poll could still benefit from further changes to increase transparency and reduce the potential for conflicts of interest. For example, broadening the panel of voters to include more non-partisan individuals or perhaps even randomly selected people could help diversify the perspectives involved. This would reduce any single group’s influence and give a more balanced and fair assessment of college football performance. Additionally, more stringent rules regarding transparency in how votes are cast and the consideration of certain criteria over others might help create a more objective ranking process.
