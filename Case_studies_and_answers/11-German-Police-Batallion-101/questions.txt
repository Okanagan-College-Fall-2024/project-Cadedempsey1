Discussion Questions:

1. Why do you think ordinary men would become willing killers? What was the role of conformity
bias in the situation described above? Explain.

2. Although conformity bias refers to our own tendency to take behavioral cues from the actions
of others around us, in what ways do you think conformity was actively encouraged by the
political climate or police forces leading the volunteers? Explain.

3. In hindsight, it is clear to see the wrongdoing of the actions of the men of Reserve Police
Battalion 101. But given the number of men who willingly killed their Jewish neighbors, the
decision to opt out may have been more complicated than simply being “not up to the task.”

Beyond conformity bias, what other cognitive biases or situational pressures may have
contributed to these men’s decision to kill? Explain. How do you think the men could have
made different choices?

contexts do you think conformity bias could play a significant role in shaping people’s behavior?
Explain.

5. Can you think of examples in other parts of the world or historical periods in which conformity
bias may have played a similar role in causing harm on a wide scale? Explain.

6. This case study illustrates an extreme example of the negative effects of conformity bias. On a
more routine basis in your own life, in what situations do you think you might encounter
conformity bias? Explain. Do you think our tendency to conform could ever produce positive
effects? Why or why not?
