1. Ordinary men became willing killers due to conformity bias, which compelled them to align their actions with the behavior of their peers. The fear of social exclusion and being labeled as weak or cowardly outweighed their moral objections. Additionally, the hierarchical structure and the normalization of violence under Nazi ideology reinforced this bias.

2. Conformity was actively encouraged through a political climate that dehumanized Jewish people and glorified loyalty to the state. Police forces fostered a sense of unity and duty among battalion members, making refusal to participate in killings seem like betrayal. The absence of significant consequences for opting out contrasted with the stigma of defying group norms, amplifying pressure to conform.

3. Beyond conformity bias, factors such as authority bias (obedience to commands from superiors), diffusion of responsibility (perceived shared guilt among the group), and moral disengagement (justifying actions as following orders) played roles. Situational pressures like desensitization to violence and fear of retaliation may have also influenced their choices. To act differently, these men would have needed moral courage, support from others who refused, or alternative avenues to fulfill their duties without killing.

4. This dynamic is not specific to militarized cultures. Conformity bias can manifest in various contexts, such as corporate environments, educational institutions, or social movements, where groupthink and peer pressure shape behavior. For instance, employees may conform to unethical practices to align with workplace norms.

5. Examples of conformity bias causing harm include the Rwandan genocide, where propaganda and peer pressure encouraged participation in mass violence, and the Jim Crow era in the United States, where systemic racism perpetuated discriminatory behavior. These events demonstrate how group norms can override individual morality on a wide scale.

6. In routine life, conformity bias may arise in decisions like agreeing with group opinions during discussions or adopting trends to fit in. While it often leads to negative outcomes, such as perpetuating harmful norms, conformity can also produce positive effects. For example, it can encourage pro-social behavior, such as participating in community service when others do the same.
