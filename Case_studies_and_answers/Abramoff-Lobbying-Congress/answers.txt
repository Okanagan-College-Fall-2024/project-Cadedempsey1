1. The blame lies not only with Abramoff individually but also with the system in which he operated. Although Abramoff made personal choices, the political system's lack of accountability and its dependency on money fostered corrupt practices that allowed Abramoff to flourish.

2. Individuals have a responsibility to act ethically within a corrupt system by upholding moral standards despite the environment. An individual would act ethically by remaining transparent, advocating for fair practices, and making choices that benefit the public, not just personal or financial interests.

3. Situational factors, such as high stakes and the need to stay discreet, may pressure lobbyists into prioritizing success over ethical considerations. The temptation to engage in unethical actions may increase when faced with immense pressure or the possibility of personal and professional gains.

4. Abramoff and his associates may have mocked their clients due to a sense of superiority or an emotional distancing from the consequences of their actions. This behavior likely stems from rationalizing their wrongdoing by viewing the clients as naive or undeserving.

5. Abramoff's advocacy for political reform after his release can be seen as a mixed result. While some might view him as a morally bankrupt figure, others could see his reform efforts as genuine, where his personal experience offers valuable lessons about the need to change the system.

6. Politicians had a moral obligation to use the contributions ethically, which may or may not involve donating to Native American tribes. Those who did donate to tribes showed some sense of responsibility, but those who did not may have prioritized their personal interests over ethical considerations.

7. To manage the conflict of interest between the Coushatta and Tigua tribes, I would establish clear transparency and prioritize ethical considerations by disclosing the dual interest to both parties. I would negotiate a fair solution that adheres to each tribe's interests without compromising both.

8. Key ethics concepts at work include conflict of interest, moral relativism, accountability, transparency, and corporate responsibility. These are significant as they underline the importance of ethical decision-making and the consequences of disregarding moral principles in lobbying.

9. Recommended legal reforms should include stricter transparency laws requiring lobbyists to disclose all financial ties and conflicts of interest, restrictions on gifts and personal travel funded by clients, and more rigorous enforcement of lobbying regulations to hold individuals accountable for unethical behavior.
