1. Enron's CEO, Ken Lay, framed the company's business model as one built on high ethical standards and transparency, claiming that their transactions were conducted at arm's length to avoid unethical situations. However, this framing was in stark contrast to the actions of employees like Tim Belden, who recognized that California's deregulated market was "prone to gaming" and used this knowledge to engage in manipulative and illegal practices. The difference in framing led to actions that were both self-serving and damaging to the broader public, creating an illusion of ethical behavior while operating in a manner that was anything but ethical.

2. Framing can significantly influence how individuals approach business conduct. When a company frames its actions in a positive light—such as promoting transparency and ethics—it can encourage employees to justify unethical behavior by rationalizing it as "necessary" or "within the rules." In Enron's case, employees framed their manipulative tactics as smart business moves, leading them to take pride in their ability to exploit loopholes. A different framing could have encouraged ethical behavior, perhaps leading to better decisions that would not have harmed consumers and the company itself.

3. Other businesses use framing tactics to market their products in ways that appeal to consumers' values or desires. For instance, companies selling "eco-friendly" products frame their goods as environmentally responsible, appealing to consumers who want to make sustainable choices. Similarly, luxury brands frame their products as symbols of status and exclusivity, influencing consumer decisions. Framing affects both the product's appeal and consumer behavior, as people are more likely to buy into narratives that align with their personal values or aspirations.

4. The recorded conversation between Greg and Shari highlights the use of framing to rationalize unethical behavior. Greg frames the manipulation and dishonesty as "marketing," suggesting that lying is part of the business model, which normalizes unethical conduct. Shari's initial reluctance, followed by her acceptance, shows how framing can shift one's perspective. This conversation reflects how powerful framing can be in influencing individuals to align with actions they may have initially viewed as wrong, illustrating the slippery slope of moral corruption in business environments.

5. If I were a new employee at Enron and learned of these framing tactics, I would feel conflicted and uneasy. I would likely feel a moral obligation to distance myself from the company's manipulative practices. In such a situation, I would consider speaking up or reporting these unethical behaviors to appropriate authorities. The realization that these practices were not only harmful but also illegal would compel me to act in a way that aligned with my ethical values, even if it meant risking my career. The broader impact on the company's stakeholders would be a strong motivating factor in my decision to take action.
