1. Why do you think the Astros began using the “Dark Arts”?
[See videos on the self-serving bias (https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/video/self-serving-
bias) and framing. (https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/video/framing)]
2. Shortly before the Astros began their sign-stealing scheme, the team’s database was hacked
by Chris Correa, the rival St. Louis Cardinals’ scouting director. He was later sentenced to 46
months in prison.23
a. How might this transgression by Correa have helped motivate the Astros’
decision to cheat?
b. Could it have given the Astros a rationalization for their own cheating? What do
you think that rationalization would be?
[See video on rationalizations.
(https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/glossary/rationalizations)]
3. How much responsibility would you place on the players? On the manager? On the general
manager? On the owner? Explain your reasoning.
4. One writer asked: “Given an open road, a sports car and the assurance no law enforcement
would be present, how fast would you drive?”24 He then noted the relative lack of
enforcement by MLB, despite widespread rumors and complaints about the Astros’ (and
perhaps some other clubs’) illegal sign-stealing. Would more surveillance, of the type MLB
used in the 2018 and 2019 playoffs when watchdogs were placed in baseball clubhouses
during the games, have made a difference? Why or why not?
5. Although some MLB players applauded Mike Fiers for coming forward about the scandal,
others criticized him for violating baseball’s supposed “code of silence.”25
a. Is that code common in professions or organizations other than MLB (and the
Mafia)? Support your answer with examples.
b. Is it part of the problem? Why or why not?
c. How might it be reformed or even ended?

bias https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/glossary/conformity-bias and In-group/outgroup.

6. In 2017 “The Athletic” reported that small groups of Astros players expressed misgivings
about the cheating. One player approached Carlos Beltran, who was a ring-leader in the
scheme and a 20-year veteran with a Hall of Fame-caliber career behind him. Beltran
“disregarded [the appeal] and steamrolled everybody.” “Where do you go if you’re a young,
impressionable player with the Astros and this guy says, ‘We’re going to do this.’ What do
Case Study – The Astros’ Sign Stealing Scandal - Page 4 of 8
you do?”26 What does this revelation tell us about obedience to authority? [See videos on
obedience to authority. https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/video/obedience-to-authority;
https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/glossary/obedience-to-authority]
7. On the other hand, Astros shortstop Carlos Correa said: “We didn’t feel scared of Beltran; we
didn’t feel intimidated. He was the nicest guy we could ever have. He was the best
teammate we could ever have. Beltran was obviously a leader of the clubhouse, but we all
had a say in everything we were doing in there.”27 How does this affect your conclusions on
the previous question?
8. In a press conference, Astros’ owner Jim Crane said: “Our players should not be punished for
these actions. These are a great group of guys who did not receive proper guidance from
their leaders.”28 It does appear that GM Luhnhow did know generally of the scheme, that
field manager Hinch definitely knew about it (and did not like it) but did little or nothing to
stop it, and that bench coach Alex Cora and team elder Carlos Beltran were active leaders of
the scheme. Does that absolve the other players? Why or why not?
9. Former Astro J.D. Davis later explained: “I was a rookie, and I was going up and down the
system, and I was fighting for my life. … As a 24-year-old at the time, I was pretty star-struck
at the time being around some of the veteran guys and being around the big-league
clubhouse and everything. I had never been part of a major-league clubhouse. Maybe what
they did was the norm, I have no idea. I had never been in another big-league clubhouse.”29
Does this sound like the conformity bias in action, or just another excuse? Explain your
reasoning.
10. There were clearly Astros players who were uncomfortable with the cheating. Why didn’t
they speak out? What about the Astros players, other than Fiers, who left the club knowing
of the scheme, but never reported it? Why didn’t they speak out?
[See videos on moral muteness https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/video/moral-muteness
and the Giving Voice to Values video series.
https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/series/giving-voice-to-values]
11. It is perfectly legal to watch the opposing teams’ pitcher and catcher with the naked eye,
even when you’re a runner standing on second base with a primo view of the catchers’
signals. And it’s legal to try to detect those signals and send them to your teammate in the
batter’s box in an attempt to give him an edge. Is the use of electronic means to do the
detecting so close to the traditional means that it doesn’t seem so bad? Explain.
a. How might this line of reasoning be influences by the slippery slope?
[See videos on incrementalism. https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/video/incrementalism
https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/glossary/incrementalism]
12. Why didn’t MLB punish the players who were involved?
Case Study – The Astros’ Sign Stealing Scandal - Page 5 of 8
a. Should the players have been punished as well as the manager and general
manager? Why or why not?
b. Why do you think the managers were allowed to keep their share of the World
Series prize money ($400,000 each)? Is this fair? Why or why not?
13. Did Rob Manfred take a deontological or a utilitarian approach to investigating and
punishing the Astros? Was it the best approach? Explain your reasoning.
[See videos on deontology https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/glossary/deontology and
utilitarianism. https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/glossary/utilitarianism]
14. In the wake of the scandal, Pete Rose – who is one of the best players in history and was
banned from the game because he gambled on baseball – asked for reinstatement.30 Does
the failure to punish the Astros’ players provide grounds for mercy toward Rose? Why or
why not?
15. Commissioner Manfred refused to strip the Astros of their championship, saying: “Once you
go down that road of changing what happens on the field, I just don’t know how you decide
where you stop.”31 Do you think the Astros should be stripped of their championship?
Explain your reasoning.
