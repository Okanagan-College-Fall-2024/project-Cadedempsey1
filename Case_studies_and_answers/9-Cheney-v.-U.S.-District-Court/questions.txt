2)
Psychological studies indicate that people have an easy time understanding how conflicts of
interest may sway the decisions of other people, but often have great difficulty perceiving that
similar conflicts might prejudice their own decisions. Is there evidence of this in the case of Cheney
v. U.S. District Court? Briefly explain.

3)
Do you think it would be easy to rule against a friend or a former employer in a high-stakes
case? Does this create a conflict of interest between a judge’s natural motivation and the duty to
render justice impartially? Why or why not?

4)
What do you think would have been the most ethically defensible action for Justice Scalia to
take? Explain your reasoning.

5)
What is your reaction to the following passage by professors Max Bazerman and Anne
Tenbrunsel commenting upon Justice Scalia’s opinion in this case:
“Scalia’s comments [on conflict of interest] indicate that he rejects or is unaware of the
unambiguous evidence on the psychological aspects of conflicts of interest. Even more troubling
than this lack of understanding are the Supreme Court’s rules which, like most guidelines and laws
that are intended to protect against conflicts of interest, guard only against intentional corruption.
Yet most instances of corruption, and unethical behavior in general, are unintentional, a product of
bounded ethicality and the fading of the ethical dimension of the problem.”
Do you agree with their assessment? Why or why not?
