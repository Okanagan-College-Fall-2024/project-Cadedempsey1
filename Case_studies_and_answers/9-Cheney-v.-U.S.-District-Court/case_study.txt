Case Study – Cheney vs. U.S. District Court - Page 1 of 3 
Cheney v. U.S. District Court 
 
On June 24, 2004, the United States Supreme Court decided the case of Cheney v. U.S. District 
Court.  Believing that U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney’s handling of an energy task force violated 
the Federal Advisory Committee Act, and suspecting undue influence in governmental 
deliberations by the energy industry, two environmental groups—the Sierra Club and Judicial 
Watch—sued to discover official documents relating to the meetings.  Cheney and other 
government defendants moved to dismiss the lawsuit, but the federal district court in Washington 
D.C. ordered defendants to produce information about the task force. Defendants appealed, and 
the Circuit Court also held that they had to turn over the information. Defendants appealed again 
to the Supreme Court. A majority of the Supreme Court, for largely procedural reasons, held that 
the Circuit Court should reconsider the appeal in light of new legal guidelines that the Supreme 
Court set out. Dissenters argued that the lower courts had ruled correctly, and the case should be 
returned to the District Court where it could go forward.  Justice Antonin Scalia voted with the 
majority, but also said that he favored dismissing the case and ruling for Cheney and the other 
defendants. Justice Scalia also filed a statement explaining why he was refusing requests that he 
recuse himself from the case.   
  
Justice Scalia’s opinion in favor of Cheney was controversial. While the case against Cheney was 
pending, Scalia had taken a widely publicized duck hunting trip with defendant Cheney and others.  
Federal law states that “any justice or judge shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his 
impartiality might be questioned.” Critics of Justice Scalia thought it reasonable to question his 
impartiality. Stephen Gillers, a New York University law professor and expert on legal ethics, noted, 
“A judge may have a friendship with a lawyer, and that’s fine. But if the lawyer has a case before 
the judge, they don’t socialize until it’s over. That shows a proper respect for maintaining the 
public’s confidence in the integrity of the process.” 
 
 
Defenders of Justice Scalia argued that these criticisms were politically motivated by people 
who wished that Scalia not be able to vote in the case. They said it is common for justices to be 
friends with political actors who might be involved in cases coming before the Court. Defending his 
actions, Scalia stated, “Social contacts with high-level executive officials…have never been thought 
improper for judges who may have before them cases in 
which those people are involved… For example, Supreme 
Court Justices are regularly invited to dine at the White 
House, whether or not a suit seeking to compel or prevent 
certain presidential action is pending.”
