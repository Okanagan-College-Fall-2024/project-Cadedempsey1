Discussion Questions:

1. What harms are potentially produced by the FBI’s demand that Apple help it open an iPhone?
What harms are potentially produced by Apple’s refusal to help the FBI?

2. Do you think Apple had a moral obligation to help the FBI open the iPhone in this case because
it involved terrorism and a mass shooting? What if the case involved a different type of criminal
activity instead, such as drug trafficking? Explain your reasoning.

3. Apple argued that helping to open one iPhone would produce code that could be used to make
private information on all iPhones vulnerable, not only to the American government but also to
other foreign governments and criminal elements. Do you agree with Apple’s “slippery slope”
argument? Does avoiding these harms provide adequate justification for Apple’s refusal to
open the phone, even if it could reveal crucial information on the terrorist shooting?

4. Politicians from across the political spectrum, including President Obama and Senator Ted Cruz,
argued that technology preventing government access to information should not exist. Do you
agree with this limit on personal privacy? Why or why not?

5. Ultimately, the FBI gained access to the iPhone in question without the help of Apple. Does this
development change your assessment of the ethical dimensions of Apple’s refusal to help the
FBI? Why or why not? Should the FBI share information on how it opened the iPhone with
Apple so that it can patch the vulnerability? Explain your reasoning.
