1. The FBI's demand that Apple help unlock the iPhone could lead to security vulnerabilities if the backdoor created for one device is exploited by criminals, foreign governments, or even the U.S. government in the future. On the other hand, Apple's refusal to help could prevent valuable evidence from being accessed, potentially hindering efforts to prevent future terrorist attacks and bringing criminals to justice.

2. Apple may have had a moral obligation to help the FBI, given the context of terrorism and a mass shooting, where lives were at stake. However, if the case involved a different type of crime, like drug trafficking, the moral obligation may be less clear, as it would depend on the severity and scope of the crime. The decision should be based on balancing privacy rights with public safety concerns.

3. I agree with Apple's "slippery slope" argument, as creating a backdoor could expose all iPhones to future vulnerabilities. Avoiding these harms does provide a strong justification for Apple's refusal, as the broader implications on user privacy could be severe, even if unlocking the phone could provide crucial information on the terrorist attack.

4. I do not agree with limiting personal privacy to such an extent that the government can access all private information. Privacy is a fundamental right, and creating vulnerabilities for law enforcement access could lead to abuse of power, surveillance overreach, and potential exploitation by unauthorized parties, undermining personal freedoms.

5. The fact that the FBI was able to access the iPhone without Apple's help does change the ethical considerations of Apple's refusal. While it suggests that Appleâ€™s refusal was not necessarily preventing crucial information from being accessed, the broader issue of privacy protection still holds. The FBI should share information with Apple on how it accessed the phone, as this could help improve security and patch vulnerabilities in future devices.
