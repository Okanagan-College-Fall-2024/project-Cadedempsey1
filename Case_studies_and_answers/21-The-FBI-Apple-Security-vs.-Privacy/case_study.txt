The FBI & Apple: Security vs. Privacy 
 
In December 2015, the FBI attained the iPhone of one of the shooters in an ISIS-inspired terrorist 
attack that killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California. As part of the investigation, the FBI 
attempted to gain access to the data stored on the phone but was unable to penetrate its encryption 
software. Lawyers for the Obama administration approached Apple for assistance with unlocking the 
device, but negotiations soon broke down. The Justice Department then obtained a court order 
compelling Apple to help the FBI unlock the phone. Apple CEO, Timothy Cook, publicly challenged the 
court in an open letter, sparking an intense debate over the balance between maintaining national 
security and protecting user privacy. 
 
Apple and its supporters, including top technology companies such as Google and Facebook, made the 
case on several fronts that the court order threatened the privacy of all individuals. First, according to 
Apple, the order effectively required the company to write code, violating its First Amendment right to 
free speech by forcing the company to “say” something it did not want to say. Previous court cases had 
already established computer code as legally protected speech. Second, such a backdoor, once 
created, could fall into the wrong hands and threaten the privacy of all iPhone owners. Finally, it would 
set a dangerous precedent; law enforcement could repeatedly require businesses such as Apple to 
assist in criminal investigations, effectively making technology companies an agent of government. 
 
Representatives from both sides of the political aisle offered several arguments in favor of the Justice 
Department’s efforts and against Apple’s stance. Their central claim was that the U.S. legal system 
establishes constraints on the government’s access to private information which prevent abuse of 
search and surveillance powers. At the same time, the law still allows authorities to gain access to 
information that facilitates prevention and prosecution of criminal activities, from terrorism to drug 
trafficking to child pornography. Critics of Apple also rejected the slippery slope argument on the 
grounds that, if Apple cooperated, it could safeguard the code it created and keep it out of the hands 
of others, including bad actors such as terrorists or criminal groups. Moreover, Apple was accused of 
being too interested in protecting its brand, and even unpatriotic for refusing to comply with the court 
order. 
 
Ultimately, the FBI dropped the case because it was able to circumvent the encryption on the iPhone 
without Apple’s help.
