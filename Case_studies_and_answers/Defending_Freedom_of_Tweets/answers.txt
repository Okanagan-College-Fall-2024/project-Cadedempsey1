1. Mendenhall did not necessarily do anything "wrong," but his tweet was controversial due to its sensitive nature. His comments on celebrating death and questioning public reactions to Bin Laden's assassination sparked backlash because many found his statements inappropriate, especially in light of national pride and respect for the U.S. military. The issue was more about the timing and the sensitivity of the topic rather than the intent behind his words.

2. The values in conflict here are freedom of speech versus social responsibility. On one hand, Mendenhall has the right to express his personal opinions, a value protected by the First Amendment. On the other hand, as a public figure, he faces societal expectations to exercise restraint and avoid statements that could be seen as offensive or controversial. We might want to defend Mendenhall's right to tweet because freedom of speech is fundamental, and public figures should be allowed to voice their thoughts, even if they provoke debate, as long as they are not inciting harm.

3. Sports figures do have special obligations to the public concerning how they speak, especially due to their influence over fans and the broader public. Their words can carry significant weight because of their visibility and the impact they have on public discourse. They should exercise care in addressing sensitive topics like politics, religion, and national pride, which can evoke strong emotions. These same standards would apply to a prominent politician, as their public statements also have a far-reaching effect, and they too should be cautious with their words to avoid undermining their credibility or causing unnecessary harm.

4. If Mendenhall were an unemployed or unsigned football player, the pressure on him to be restrained in his speech might lessen. Without a brand endorsement or team affiliation, he would not face the same consequences in terms of losing sponsorships or public trust tied to his role as a representative of those brands or organizations. However, the principle of freedom of speech would still apply, and he would still be subject to public opinion and criticism, though not necessarily the same professional obligations or corporate consequences.

5. Sports journalists should cover Mendenhall's tweets and the subsequent controversy because his comments sparked public debate and raised questions about the role of public figures in addressing sensitive topics. The controversy involves not just his opinion but the larger implications of social media as a platform for public discourse. Covering such incidents allows for discussion of freedom of speech, social responsibility, and the intersection of personal views with professional roles in the public eye.
