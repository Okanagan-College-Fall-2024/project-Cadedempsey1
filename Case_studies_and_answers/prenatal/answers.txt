1. **Opponents of the legislation argue that limiting a woman's freedom to terminate a pregnancy infringes on her autonomy and right to make personal medical decisions. It forces women to carry pregnancies to term regardless of personal, emotional, or financial considerations, potentially leading to harm such as increased mental and physical stress.**  
   **Supporters of the legislation argue that allowing abortion based on genetic abnormalities, such as Down syndrome, sends a harmful message that individuals with disabilities are less valuable or worthy of life. The harm, in their view, is that it promotes the idea that the lives of disabled individuals are less important, contributing to a form of eugenics.**

2. **The moral agents in this case include the pregnant woman (who decides whether to continue or terminate the pregnancy), the medical professionals (who provide prenatal care and counseling), legislators (who create and enforce laws), and society as a whole (which upholds or challenges these laws).**  
   **The subjects of moral worth are the fetus and the individuals with disabilities (such as those with Down syndrome), as their lives and rights are central to the discussion of abortion and the value society places on persons with disabilities. The pregnant woman also holds moral worth, as her autonomy and decision-making capacity are critical in this issue.**

3. **It is ethically permissible, within the framework of Roe v. Wade, for a woman to seek an abortion during the first trimester. However, the ethical question revolves around whether the reasons for terminating a pregnancy, such as the discovery of a disability, should influence the decision. The ethical issue isn't the legality of the abortion, but whether the motivation based on disability should be considered morally acceptable or discriminatory. If the pregnancy termination is based on the fetus having a disability, it raises concerns about societal attitudes towards disability.**

4. **If it is legal to abort babies with disabilities, the message conveyed might be that individuals with disabilities are less worthy of life, suggesting that society does not value their lives equally. This could perpetuate harmful stereotypes and stigma against people with disabilities, devaluing them as less important than those without disabilities. On the other hand, it could reflect the complex and personal nature of decision-making for parents facing difficult circumstances.**

5. **Yes, the Ohio Legislature would have an ethical responsibility to ensure that families are not financially and emotionally burdened by the costs of raising children with disabilities. If the state limits reproductive choices, it must consider the financial implications for families who may lack resources. The state should provide adequate support to parents who choose to raise children with disabilities, ensuring they do not face undue hardship.**

6. **Physicians should not be required to divulge the motivation for terminating a pregnancy, as doing so could breach the confidentiality between doctor and patient, which is vital to maintaining trust and ensuring honest communication. The motivation for a medical decision should remain private unless there is a compelling public health or legal reason to disclose it, which in this case is questionable.**

7. **In a free society, parents should have the freedom to decide whether to terminate a pregnancy based on factors such as discovering a fetus will be born deaf or diabetic, especially if these conditions would cause significant financial, emotional, and physical strain. The government should avoid excessive interference in such deeply personal decisions, as each familyâ€™s situation is unique, and the potential for hardship should be taken into account. Limiting reproductive choices based on potential burdens infringes on personal autonomy and can lead to inequities.**
