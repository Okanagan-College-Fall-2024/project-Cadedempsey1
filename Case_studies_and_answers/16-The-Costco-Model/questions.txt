Discussion Questions:

1. How does Costco, as described, match up to the “best practices” explained in the video? Where
does Costco fall short? Where does Costco succeed?

2. Walmart pays its employees substantially less than does Costco, even though the two
companies often compete head-to-head. How can Costco stay in business when it pays up to
40% more to its employees than its direct competitors?

3. What do you think are the most important practices for a retail company to pursue to foster an
ethical environment for workers and consumers? Why?

4. A stock analyst criticized Costco, saying: “Costco continues to be a company that is better at
serving the club member and employee than the shareholder.” Do you think this a fair critique?
Why or why not?

5. Another analyst complained that Jim Sinegal “has been too benevolent. He’s right that a happy
employee is a productive long-term employee, but he could force employees to pick up a little
more of the burden.” Again, do you think this a fair criticism? Why or why not?

6. Is a company that does not follow the Costco model a “bad” company? Explain.
