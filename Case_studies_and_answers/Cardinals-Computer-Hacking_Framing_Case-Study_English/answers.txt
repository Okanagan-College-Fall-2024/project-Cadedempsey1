1. It appears that Correa had a framing problem because he lacked an ethical frame of reference when engaging in his hacking scheme. He viewed his actions through the lens of competition, focusing on retaliation and the notion that it was just part of the game. By rationalizing his behavior as part of the competitive nature of baseball, he failed to acknowledge the gravity of the unethical and illegal aspects of his actions, such as hacking into another team's private system.

2. No, the fact that Correa was involved in high-level competition does not justify violating moral standards or the law. In any competitive environment, whether in sports or elsewhere, the rules and laws exist to ensure fairness, respect, and integrity. Just as you are not justified in breaking into someone else's home to find stolen items, Correa's actions of hacking were neither morally nor legally acceptable. The proper course of action would have been to address concerns through legitimate means, not to resort to illegal activities.

3. The self-serving bias likely played a role in Correa’s actions. When Correa believed the Cardinals were wronged, he may have subconsciously justified his illegal actions by seeing them as a response to the perceived injustice, thus downplaying the ethical violations. The subconscious desire to benefit personally, and for his team, from this illicit information might have led him to disregard ethical considerations. This internal bias made it easier for Correa to omit ethics from his frame of reference while acting.

4. Yes, if someone is blind to the impact of their actions on others, they likely have a framing problem. Ethics require a consideration of the consequences of one’s actions on others. When Correa eventually realized the disrespect caused by his actions, it became clear that he had been overlooking the personal and professional consequences for those he affected. His failure to initially understand this shows how his frame of reference had not properly included the necessary ethical considerations about privacy and respect.

5. Leo Durocher’s quote, "Winning isn’t everything. It’s the only thing," presents a framing problem because it elevates winning above all other ethical considerations, including honor, fairness, and integrity. By framing success in this way, Durocher placed the ultimate value on outcomes, regardless of the means used to achieve them. This mindset can contribute to justifying unethical behaviors to achieve victory, as Correa did. Winning with honor should be the ideal, as it ensures that success is achieved in a way that upholds respect and fairness.
