1. Reiter writes: “While [Correa] knew what he was doing wasn’t right, he never thought that it
could be a crime. ‘It was all in the context of a game, to me,’ he says. ‘When a pitcher throws at
a batter’s chest, nobody runs to the local authorities and tries to file an assault charge. I’m not
making excuses. I’m trying to explain where my head was at, as I now understand it. If another
team does something wrong, you retaliate. That’s the lens through which I mistakenly viewed
it, and I used that to give myself permission. It was wrong.’” It appears that Correa did not have
ethics in his frame of reference when he launched his hacking scheme. Does it appear to you
that he had a framing problem? Explain.
2. Is the fact that Correa was involved in a competition at the highest levels of baseball provide
sufficient justification for his violating moral standards and/or the law?
1. If you suspect that someone has broken into your house and stolen something, are you
morally and/or legally justified in breaking into their house to see if you can locate your
stuff there? The judge who sentenced Correa didn’t think so. Do you? Why or why not?
3. Reiter also writes: “There is another theory to explain Correa’s actions. It is that even if his
intrusions came from a feeling that the Cardinals had themselves been violated, he used that to
justify behavior that turned into something like a compulsion, rooted in both voyeurism and the
fact that the information acquired by illicitly peering into a chief rival’s brain—and seeing the
basis for every decision it made—provided an undeniable advantage to both the Cardinals and
his own career.” If you have viewed the video on the self-serving bias, would you think that it
might sometimes provide subconscious motivation for people to downplay ethics—to drop it
out of their frame of reference-- when they make decisions? Explain why or why not.
4. Later, Correa had a realization: “What was really surreal to me was when I stood back and
recognized how essentially disrespectful my behavior was of the people whose privacy I
violated.” If you are blind to the impact that your actions have on others, do you automatically
have a framing problem? Explain.
5. At the end of the day, Correa seems to be another good person who did a bad thing and has
paid a serious price. At sentencing, he said that this was “the worst thing I’ve done in my life by
far, and I am overwhelmed with remorse and regret.” Famed player and coach Leo Durocher
once said: “Winning isn’t everything. It’s the only thing.” Did Durocher also have a framing
problem? Was he right, or should winning with honor be the only thing? What is your view?
Explain.
