Discussion Questions:

1. The retraction did harm Chandok’s ability to pursue a career in science. Do you think Klessig
should have retracted the article published in Cell without conclusive evidence that Chandok
had fabricated the results? Explain.

2. Do you think Chandok had a moral obligation to return to the laboratory at Klessig’s request to
replicate her results? Why or why not?

3. If the article had been published in a less prominent journal and the results were of much less
significance, do you think this would have altered the decision to retract the publication?
Explain.

4. Klessig’s decision to retract the article was based only on the inability of his laboratory to
replicate Chandok’s results, not specifically on the credibility of her character. Do you think
Chandok was ethically justified in suing for defamation? Why or why not?

5. There were four authors on the Cell paper, including Klessig and Chandok. If another of the
authors besides Chandok also opposed the decision to retract the article, should this have
changed whether or not Klessig should have gone ahead with the retraction? Why or why not?

6. In collaborative research projects involving multiple authors or researchers, how should
responsibility ideally and ethically be shared? How would you approach collaboration in this
situation?

7. If Klessig had no reason to doubt Chandok’s abilities or honesty, would he have a moral
obligation to write letters of recommendation for her explaining that his retraction did not in
any way reflect on her potential to do quality research and be a significant asset to whatever
laboratory or institute she joined? Why or why not?
