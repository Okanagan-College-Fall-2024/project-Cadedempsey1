Retracting Research: The Case of Chandok v. Klessig 
 
In 2003, a research team from prominent laboratory the Boyce Thompson Institute (BTI) for Plant 
Research in Ithaca, New York published an article in the prestigious academic journal Cell. It was 
considered a breakthrough paper in that it answered a major question in the field of plant cell biology. 
The first author of this paper was postdoctoral researcher Meena Chandok, working under her 
supervisor Daniel Klessig, president of BTI at the time.  
 
After Chandok left BTI for another job, other researchers in the laboratory were unable to repeat the 
results published in Cell, following exactly the same methods described in the article.  Klessig, 
suspecting possible scientific misconduct, requested Chandok to return to the laboratory to redo her 
experiments and confirm the authenticity of her results, but she declined. An institutional investigation 
into the experiment concluded there “was no conclusive evidence that Dr. Chandok achieved the 
results reported,” but also that there was “no conclusive evidence” of misconduct or that Chandok had 
fabricated the results. Klessig and the other co-authors retracted the article without Chandok’s 
agreement. Chandok subsequently sued Klessig for defamation, claiming the retraction had caused 
significant damage to her career and reputation within the scientific community.  
 
Over several years in court, the case drew attention to a number of issues in scientific research and 
publishing. John Travis, an editor at Science magazine, wrote of the case’s consistency with “the 
National Institutes of Health’s grant policy that researchers should come forward with concerns about 
possible misconduct.” John Dahlberg, director of the Office of Research Integrity’s Division of 
Investigative Oversight, believed the case could encourage anyone with fear of being sued for 
defamation to come forward. Science writer Eugenie Reich described Klessig as a “whistle-blower,” 
while philosopher Janet Stemwedel raised questions surrounding the collaborative responsibility of the 
coauthors and Klessig with regard to quality control for the research. She asked, “If credit is shared, 
why isn’t blame?” 
 
In 2011, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York dismissed the case. It ruled that 
Klessig’s statements were legally protected because they were “matters as to which the speaker [had] 
a legal or moral obligation” to notify the journal that his 
laboratory could not replicate the results they had published 
and were made between “communicants who [shared] a 
common interest.” The court found there was no proof of 
malice toward Chandok and that the investigation and 
attempts requesting Chandok to replicate her work left the 
question of scientific misconduct open.
