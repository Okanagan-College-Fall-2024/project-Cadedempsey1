Discussion Questions:

1.	Should athletes have unrestricted freedom of speech on social media sites? Why or why not?

2.	What values or interests are at stake here for athletes, coaches, and universities? Which values should take precedence in cases of conflict? Why?
 

3.	If some coaches are found to be misusing Twitter, should universities ban all future tweets from all their coaches? Why is (or isn’t) this comparable to the restrictions debated on student athletes on social media?

4.	Do you agree with the “creative” solutions of UDiligence and similar measures? What would you do differently if you where an administrator at one such a university?

5.	What ethical duties should college athletes think about while they are using social media? Are these different from the ethical ways non‐athletes should use social media? Would you be able to write (and justify) an “Athlete’s Code of Ethics” for Tweeting or using Facebook?
