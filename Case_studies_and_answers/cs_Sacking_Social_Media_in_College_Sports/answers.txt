1. Athletes should not have unrestricted freedom of speech on social media sites because their online behavior can have negative impacts on their team, university, and personal reputation. Public statements can affect the image of the university or team, and social media can amplify misinformation or harmful content.

2. The values at stake include freedom of expression, the reputation of athletes and universities, and maintaining a professional and respectful public image. In conflicts, the reputation and professional conduct of the university and team should take precedence as it reflects on their institutional values.

3. If coaches misuse Twitter, banning all future tweets is not an appropriate solution because it limits the professional and recruiting benefits that social media can offer. It is not comparable to student-athletes, as coaches hold positions of authority and can use social media for communication purposes with recruits and the public.

4. I agree with the use of UDiligence and similar measures, as they offer monitoring to protect both the students and the universityâ€™s reputation. As an administrator, I would balance monitoring with education, ensuring athletes understand the impact of their online behavior and offering support when necessary.

5. College athletes should consider their public image, respect for teammates and coaches, and the impact of their posts on their university and career. These duties are similar to those of non-athletes, but athletes have additional responsibilities due to their role as public figures. An Athlete's Code of Ethics should emphasize professionalism, respect, and responsible use of social media.
