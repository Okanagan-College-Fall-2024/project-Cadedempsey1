Discussion Questions:
1.	In the case study above, do you think the ends justify the means? In other words, does the goal of discharging the patient from an institutional setting into normal community living justify deceiving him? Explain your reasoning.

2.	Do you think it is ever ethically permissible to deceive clients? Under what circumstances? Why or why not?

3.	To what degree should family members or legal guardians have full capacity to make decisions or give consent on behalf of those under their care? Explain.

4.	Do you think severely mentally ill people retain any rights “to determine what shall be done with [their] own [bodies]?” Why or why not?

5.	Are there risks in surreptitiously medicating a paranoid patient? Would this confirm the patient’s delusions of being “poisoned” by others or escalate his resistance to treatment? Are these risks worth taking in view of the potential to dramatically improve his mental functioning and reduce his suffering?

6.	Since psychiatric patients have the right to treatment, does the strategy to surreptitiously administer medications serve this goal? Do you think this is ethically justifiable? Why or why not?

7.	Does the history of the forcible treatments of persons with disabilities and other powerless populations affect how you view this case? Explain
