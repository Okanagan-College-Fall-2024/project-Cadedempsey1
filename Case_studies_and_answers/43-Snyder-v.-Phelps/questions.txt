1. How would you rule in this case if you were the deciding vote on the Supreme Court? Why?
What issues would you find most important in making that decision?
2. Does the fact that the Westboro Baptist Church did everything legally correct make their
position acceptable? Should they adhere to any ethical boundaries beyond legal compliance?
Why or why not?
3. How would you explain to both the Westboro Baptist Church and Albert Snyder the Supreme
Court’s ruling while respecting both of their positions?
4. Can you think of any alternative methods by which the Westboro Baptist Church could make
the same point without causing harm to individuals such as Albert Snyder? Explain.
5. Do you believe it is ethically permissible for someone to say whatever he or she wants, even if it
causes harm or trauma to another person? If so, on what grounds? If not, where would you
draw the line to limit speech? Explain.
