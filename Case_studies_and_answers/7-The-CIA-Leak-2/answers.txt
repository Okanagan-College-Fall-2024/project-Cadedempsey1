1. Joseph Wilson was most subject to bounded ethicality in this case because he had personal and professional stakes in the matter. As a U.S. diplomat and the husband of a covert CIA agent, he was ethically bound to speak out about the misinformation on the yellowcake uranium claims, despite potential political risks and pressures.

2. The situational factors in this case—such as the political environment, national security concerns, and the pressure to uphold party loyalty—posed challenges to ethical decision-making. These pressures could create a sense of urgency or self-interest that undermined impartial ethical reflection.

3. Bush, Cheney, and Libby were influenced by bounded ethicality in how they justified their decisions within their political and ideological context, focusing on protecting national interests, party loyalty, and their administration's image. Psychological factors, such as groupthink and the desire to preserve power, may have led them to overlook the broader ethical implications of their actions.

4. President Bush's actions were not ethically ideal because, while he committed to prosecuting any wrongdoing, his failure to fully act on the leaks and protect Plame, combined with his commutation of Libby’s sentence, demonstrated a lack of accountability and objectivity, prioritizing political relationships over moral responsibility.

5. If I were in President Bush's position, I would have handled the situation by prioritizing transparency and accountability. Ensuring that those involved in the leak were held responsible for compromising national security and the CIA’s operations would minimize harm by sending a clear message about the importance of safeguarding intelligence and the public trust.

6. Pardoning Libby was not ethically permissible because it undermined the legal consequences of his perjury and obstruction, thereby encouraging the idea that powerful individuals can evade responsibility for serious offenses, especially in matters of national security.

7. Plame's suggestion that Libby's pardon causes further harm holds merit because it sends a message that political figures can be absolved of wrongdoings, eroding public trust and confidence in the justice system. This action jeopardizes the safety and operational integrity of covert operatives and the CIA's capacity to protect its agents.
