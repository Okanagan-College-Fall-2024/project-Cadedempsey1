4.	Is it more problematic for a white actor to portray a person of color than for an actor of color to perform a role written for a white person. Why or why not?

5.	How does the history of racial and ethnic discrimination in the United States factor into this debate?
6.	In what ways does scarcity of opportunities and representations affect perceptions of minority groups?

7.	How can producers and casting directors appropriately represent characters on stage and screen? Should artists and producers purposefully be more inclusive or should they cast regardless of race? Explain your reasoning.
