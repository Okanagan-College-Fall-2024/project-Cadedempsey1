1. B.D. Wong critiqued the production because casting Jonathan Pryce, a white actor, as the Eurasian character "the Engineer" was seen as an example of yellow-face, a practice where non-Asian actors are cast in roles written for Asian characters. This perpetuates harmful stereotypes and reinforces cultural misrepresentation. It denies Asian American actors opportunities for prominent roles, contributing to the underrepresentation of Asian talent in the industry. The harm caused by yellow-face affects Asian communities by reinforcing racial stereotypes and limiting their visibility in more diverse, non-stereotypical roles.

2. Frank Rich argued that not allowing Pryce to perform would harm the production by depriving it of its most talented actor. He justified his argument by claiming that Pryce's performance was integral to the success of the musical. Rich felt that casting based on talent, rather than racial considerations, would result in the best possible performance and maintain the artistic integrity of the show. He implied that prioritizing racial authenticity over talent would lead to a lesser performance.

3. The continued casting of white actors as Asian characters likely persists due to systemic inequalities in the entertainment industry. Asian actors often face limited opportunities and are often relegated to stereotypical or minor roles, which creates a situation where white actors are seen as the default choice for leading roles. Additionally, there may be assumptions that white actors can attract larger audiences or bring more "marketability" to a production, contributing to this ongoing practice.

4. It can be more problematic for a white actor to portray a person of color than for an actor of color to perform a role written for a white character, primarily because of the historical context of racial power dynamics. When a white actor portrays a person of color, it can be seen as appropriating the culture and identity of marginalized groups, perpetuating stereotypes, and reinforcing systemic inequalities. On the other hand, when an actor of color plays a white character, it does not carry the same historical baggage or cultural appropriation. However, casting should always prioritize authenticity and fairness, regardless of race.

5. The history of racial and ethnic discrimination in the U.S. plays a significant role in this debate. For much of American history, people of color, particularly African Americans and Asian Americans, were systematically excluded from major roles in theatre, film, and television. The use of blackface and yellow-face was historically used to degrade and mock people of color. This legacy of discrimination is deeply embedded in cultural practices, and the debate surrounding yellow-face in *Miss Saigon* highlights how those historical inequalities continue to affect casting practices and the representation of minority groups in the media.

6. The scarcity of opportunities and representations for minority groups contributes to skewed perceptions of these groups. When minority groups are underrepresented or depicted through stereotypes, it affects how the broader public views their culture, capabilities, and worth. It can also perpetuate harmful stereotypes, shaping societal attitudes in negative ways. For example, limited opportunities for Asian actors to portray complex characters contribute to the perception that they are less capable or deserving of leading roles.

7. Producers and casting directors can represent characters appropriately by making concerted efforts to ensure diverse and authentic casting choices. This may involve actively seeking out talent from underrepresented groups and considering racial and cultural identity when casting characters that are integral to the plot. While casting should always prioritize the talent of the actor, producers and casting directors should be intentional about inclusivity to avoid perpetuating historical exclusion and marginalization. Purposefully being more inclusive ensures fair representation and helps foster a more equitable industry for all actors, regardless of race.
