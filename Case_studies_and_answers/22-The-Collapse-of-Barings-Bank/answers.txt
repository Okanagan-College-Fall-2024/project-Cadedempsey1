1. Loss aversion is evident in Nick Leeson's conduct because, after suffering an initial small loss, he chose to hide it rather than report it. Instead of acknowledging the loss and accepting it, he attempted to recover the money by making increasingly risky bets. This behavior reflects the psychological tendency to avoid the pain of a loss, leading him to take more dangerous actions to reverse the situation.

2. All three explanations likely played a role in Leeson's behavior. His fear of failure and humiliation (loss aversion) pushed him to hide his losses and attempt to recover them through risky trades. His ego and greed, shaped by the competitive and high-pressure trading environment, made him overconfident in his ability to recover and made him more willing to gamble. Lastly, the stress he experienced likely led to cognitive distortions, such as overconfidence and denial, making him believe he could fix the situation, even when it was beyond control.

3. The blame seems to lie primarily with Leeson, as he made the individual choice to hide his losses and continue taking risks. However, the system in which he operated was also flawed. The lack of oversight and supervision from Barings Bank allowed Leeson to continue his actions unchecked. Therefore, the blame is shared between Leeson’s individual decisions and the systemic failures that enabled him to continue his fraudulent behavior.

4. If I were in Leeson’s position after the initial loss, I would have reported the loss immediately, rather than trying to cover it up. By confronting the issue early, I could have worked with the company to find a solution and avoid the escalating situation. Owning up to mistakes is crucial in mitigating further damage and maintaining integrity.

5. Personally, I do not have trouble owning up to mistakes, as I believe it is essential to learn from them and move forward. However, I know others who struggle with this, often due to fear of judgment or negative consequences. For example, a friend once delayed admitting an error at work because they were afraid it would affect their reputation, but ultimately, owning up to it and taking responsibility led to a positive outcome in the long run.
