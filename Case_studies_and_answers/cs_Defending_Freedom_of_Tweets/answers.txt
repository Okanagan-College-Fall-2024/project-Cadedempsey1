1. Mendenhall did not necessarily do anything wrong in expressing his personal opinion, as he was exercising his right to free speech. However, his comments were controversial due to their timing and the sensitive nature of the event he commented on—the assassination of Osama Bin Laden. His tweets were perceived by many as disrespectful, especially given the celebration of Bin Laden's death in the U.S. It can be argued that the issues were not with the content itself, but with how they were communicated at such a charged moment in history. The backlash stems from a public figure’s remarks being seen as offensive in the context they were made.

2. The key values in conflict here include free speech versus social responsibility. We might want to defend Mendenhall’s right to tweet because of his fundamental right to express his opinions, especially in a public forum like Twitter. The principle of freedom of speech protects individuals from government interference in their expression of thoughts, and even if his views were unpopular, Mendenhall is entitled to share them. Additionally, the idea of provocation and stimulating conversation about important issues is another reason his right to speak should be defended, even if the opinions provoke discomfort or disagreement.

3. Sports figures do have a special obligation to the public concerning how they speak, especially on highly sensitive or polarizing issues. As public figures, athletes like Mendenhall have significant visibility and influence. Their words can resonate with a wide audience and sometimes reflect broader societal issues. While they have the same right to express opinions as anyone else, their statements are often scrutinized more harshly due to their visibility. These standards of caution and responsibility could also be applied to prominent politicians, but the level of scrutiny might vary based on their role and how their statements affect national discourse.

4. If Mendenhall were unemployed or unsigned, the expectation of his public responsibility might shift slightly. Without corporate endorsements or ties to an organization like the Steelers, his words might have been seen as a more private expression of his views rather than representing a larger brand or team. Companies and teams may be more lenient with individuals who do not directly affect their reputation, though he would still likely face backlash for potentially offensive comments. In such a case, the expectation of corporate entities to dissociate from him would diminish, but he would still be subject to public criticism based on his statements' content.

5. Sports journalists should cover Mendenhall’s tweets and the subsequent controversy because it touches on several important topics, including freedom of speech, the responsibility of public figures, and the relationship between sports and larger societal issues. Given the public backlash, his apology, and the fallout from corporate sponsors like Champion, there is public interest in this story. Sports journalism plays a key role in not only reporting on athletes' performances but also exploring their roles as influencers and how their views resonate beyond the sports world.
