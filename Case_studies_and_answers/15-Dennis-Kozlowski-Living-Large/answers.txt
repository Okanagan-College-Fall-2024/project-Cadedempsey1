1. Kozlowski was an effective leader in terms of his ability to drive growth and expand Tyco through strategic mergers and acquisitions, which led to the company’s success. However, his actions were not ethically permissible. He used corporate funds for personal expenses, including lavish gifts and parties, and made unauthorized payments to board members, which resulted in criminal charges.

2. Entitlement bias likely led Kozlowski to feel that he was deserving of the lavish lifestyle he was living, regardless of the ethical implications. As CEO, he might have believed that his success and the company's growth gave him the right to use corporate funds for personal enjoyment.

3. Kozlowski might have rationalized his actions by convincing himself that he was entitled to these rewards due to his role in the company's success. He might have also believed that his contributions to Tyco's growth justified his behavior, or that the funds were available for personal use since the company was doing well.

4. If I were in Kozlowski's position, my actions could lead to a loss of trust and respect among employees. If employees witnessed their CEO using corporate resources for personal gain, they might feel demotivated, disillusioned, or even empowered to act similarly, undermining company morale and ethical standards.

5. Another example of leaders abusing power could be Bernie Madoff, who orchestrated one of the largest Ponzi schemes in history. Like Kozlowski, Madoff took advantage of his position to commit fraud, although the scale and nature of their crimes differed. Both abused their power to enrich themselves at the expense of others, though Madoff’s actions were on a much larger financial scale and affected a broader group of victims.
