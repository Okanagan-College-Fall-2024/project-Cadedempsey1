1. **Explanation**: Yes, it would likely be more difficult for a younger athlete to resist a coach's unethical orders than for an older athlete. Younger athletes may feel more pressure to conform and be influenced by their coaches, especially since they may be less experienced and more dependent on the coach for guidance and approval. They may also fear the consequences of refusing to follow orders, such as being removed from the team or facing disciplinary actions.

2. **Explanation**: Yes, if I were a marginal player fighting for playing time, I might find it more difficult to resist such an unethical instruction. The fear of losing my place on the team, along with the desire to fit in and prove myself, could make it harder to say no. On the other hand, as a star player, I might feel more secure in my position and have more autonomy to resist unethical instructions.

3. **Explanation**: Yes, this still reflects the **obedience to authority** phenomenon. Even though the athlete knew that the coach's instructions were wrong, the pressure from the coach to comply made the athlete feel justified in going along with it. This is a common manifestation of obedience, where individuals follow authority figures' orders, even when they believe those orders are unethical, due to the perceived lack of choice or fear of consequences.

4. **Explanation**: Yes, it makes sense that it would be more difficult to resist unethical instructions in a dictatorship than in a tightly-run corporation. A dictatorship often involves more intense control, fear, and punishment, which can make resistance more challenging. In contrast, a corporation, even if tightly managed, might provide more space for dissent or alternative choices. The presence of 3,000 STASI moles makes it even harder to resist, as fear of being reported to authorities could deter any opposition.

5. **Explanation**: Yes, it is understandable that the doctors and coaches might have followed instructions due to fear and pressure from the STASI, who were among the most feared secret police in history. The extreme control and surveillance likely left the doctors and coaches feeling that they had no choice but to comply with the orders, as defiance could lead to severe consequences.

   a. **Explanation**: The doctors and coaches likely justified their actions to themselves by rationalizing that they were merely following orders from their superiors, and that their roles were part of a larger, state-sanctioned mission. They may have viewed their actions as contributing to the success of their nation and system, which provided a sense of purpose or justification. To others, they might have explained their behavior by emphasizing the pressure they were under to succeed and deliver results.

6. **Explanation**: Yes, there are parallels between the way the GDR ran its doping program and the way Enron managed its fraudulent activities. In both cases, there was significant pressure from superiors to comply with unethical instructions, and fear of retaliation or punishment prevented individuals from speaking out. Both environments fostered a culture of fear and conformity, where doing the "right" thing was overshadowed by the pressure to meet the demands of those in power.

7. **Explanation**: Athletes who resisted authority likely succeeded in doing so because they had a strong personal sense of right and wrong, were willing to face the consequences of their actions, and possibly had the support of others who shared similar beliefs. Some might have been able to resist due to an inner conviction or a desire to protect their long-term health and well-being.

8. **Explanation**: Yes, the **self-serving bias** likely played a role in the athletes' obedience. The benefits of sports stardom, such as better living conditions, travel opportunities, and improved social status, were significant incentives. The athletes might have justified their participation in the doping program by focusing on the immediate rewards, rather than considering the long-term consequences of their actions.

9. **Explanation**: Yes, the self-serving bias likely reinforced the obedience of doctors and coaches as well. They may have seen their actions as justified by the personal benefits they received, such as power, status, and money. The self-serving bias could have led them to rationalize their involvement, focusing on the immediate advantages and ignoring or minimizing the harm caused by their actions.

10. **Explanation**: The sports doctor's observation highlights a common defense used by individuals involved in unethical systemsâ€”justifying their actions by suggesting that they were simply fulfilling a role within a system that demanded compliance. The comparison to Nazi Germany shows how individuals in oppressive regimes can rationalize their actions, even when they know what they are doing is wrong. This reflects a tendency to avoid taking personal responsibility for unethical behavior when under pressure from authority.

11. **Explanation**: Yes, Yuliya Stepanova's actions reflect **obedience to authority**. She followed her coaches' orders without questioning them, which is a hallmark of obedience, especially in an environment where the coach is seen as the figure of authority. This situation is similar to the GDR doping program because it shows how athletes, under pressure and in a system that encourages compliance, may go along with unethical practices, even when they know they are wrong.

   a. **Explanation**: Yes, this situation is very similar to the GDR program, as it involves state-sponsored doping and athletes following the unethical instructions of coaches. Both systems show how the pressure to conform and the desire to succeed can lead to participation in doping.

   b. **Explanation**: The pattern of cheating continues in professional sports due to a combination of factors, such as intense competition, the desire for success, and the pressure to perform at the highest levels. Athletes and coaches may justify the use of performance-enhancing drugs as a way to meet these demands, even at the expense of ethics.

   c. **Explanation**: Other behavioral ethics factors that might play a role include **groupthink**, where individuals conform to the actions of a group, and **cognitive dissonance**, where people justify unethical behavior to align with their actions and reduce the discomfort of doing something wrong.
