1. Because the anabolic steroids were detectable in the body for a period of time after
ingestion, the GDR doctors substituted testosterone injections for the steroid pills just
before meets when the athletes would be tested. One 15-year-old female swimmer
initially refused the injections before a relay, but was pressured by her coach and gave
in. Do you think it would be more difficult for a younger athlete to resist a coach’s
unethical orders than an older athlete? If so, why?
2. At the 3:30 mark in the Ethics Unwrapped video on Bounded Ethicality
(https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/video/bounded-ethicality), a student discusses a
situation where a soccer coach might unethically encourage players to be especially
rough with their opponents. Would you resist such an instruction?
a. Would you find it more difficult to say ‘no’ if you were a marginal player fighting
for playing time than if you were a star on the team? Explain.
3. A GDR triple jumper resisted doping, but his coach pressured him, telling him that he
needed the drugs to be competitive and so he had to take them. Then, the triple jumper
felt justified in doping because his coach had coerced him. In other words, this was not a
case where he trusted the coach and assumed that what the coach said to do was a
proper thing to do. Rather, he knew that it was wrong to follow the coach’s instructions,
but he could tell himself that he didn’t really have any choice. Is this still a manifestation
of the obedience to authority phenomenon? Why or why not?
4. One GDR athlete noted: “We had no choice because we were under a dictatorship.”
Does it make sense to you that it might be more difficult to resist the unethical
instructions of a superior in a dictatorship than in a tightly-run corporation? Why or why
not?
a. Given that there were more than 3,000 STASI moles within the sport system who
informed the state of what athletes said and did, does this change your thinking?
If so, how?
5. Sports doctors and coaches knew about the adverse effects that the steroids they gave
would have upon athletes’ long-term health, but they did it anyway. The doctors signed
confidentiality agreements promising to keep the side-effects secret. The agreements
were monitored by the STASI. Given that the STASI were among the most feared secret
police in history, is it understandable that the doctors and coaches might have followed
instructions? Explain your reasoning.

a. How do you think the doctors and coaches justified their actions to themselves?
What about to others? Discuss.
6. One of the big frauds of the Enron era involved HealthSouth, a huge company that
manipulated financial statements to hide its shaky status. Five different CFOs testified
that CEO Richard Scrushy “managed greatly by fear and intimidation,” leading them to
feel afraid to blow the whistle or even to leave the company. When one CFO threatened
to quit, Scrushy told him that he couldn’t because Scrushy would make him the “fall
guy.” Do you see parallels with the way the GDR ran its doping program? Explain.
7. Some athletes, like the one who gained 45 pounds of muscle, managed to stand up to
the authorities and say ‘no.’ What enabled these athletes to succeed in resisting
authority? Do you have any theories?
8. In the GDR, successful athletes led relatively privileged lives as compared to the
common citizen. They received better housing, access to cars, improved job prospects,
and the ability to travel abroad. To refuse to participate in the doping program meant
that, in all likelihood, the athlete would be removed from the program. That would
mean being deprived of the benefits that went with sports stardom – for the athlete and
for their family. Is it possible that the self-serving bias was one of the reasons that
athletes tended to be obedient to authority…to follow instructions to cheat? Explain.
9. Critics have argued that the doctors and coaches went along with the doping scheme
“to earn money, be important, to be someone.” Is it possible that the self-serving biased
reinforced these doctors’ and coaches’ natural tendency to be obedience to authority?
Explain.
10. One of the GDR sports doctors said:
“I have friends who tell me that if I had not injected these teenage swimmers…someone
else would have stepped in and replaced me. Of course, that was the same excuse used
during the Third Reich that if we didn’t respond to Hitler, another doctor would have
fulfilled the function. I should have shown more courage. In Nazi Germany we all did
what we were told to do. The GDR doping machine was no different; we were just
carrying out our medical orders, never questioning the system that was good to us, just
doing our jobs. Have we not learned anything?”
What do you think of this observation?
11. Around 2017, it became clear that for 40 years Russia has continued to run a doping
system similar to the GDR’s. Russian runner Yuliya Stepanova, who became a
whistleblower, told reporters that she had been committed to doing everything her
coaches asked of her: “I train like they say, I take drugs like they say.” Does this sound
like obedience to authority? Explain.

a. This situation sounds very similar to the GDR program that was busted in the
1980s. Do you agree? Why or why not?
b. Why do you think this pattern of cheating continues to live on in professional
sports?
c. What other behavioral ethics factors might play a role? Discuss
