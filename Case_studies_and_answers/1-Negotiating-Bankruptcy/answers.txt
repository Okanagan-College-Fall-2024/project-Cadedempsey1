1. Concepts from behavioral ethics apparent in this case include ethical fading (failure to recognize ethical dimensions of decisions), obedience to authority (pressure from higher-ups like Lederman), and overconfidence bias (belief in one’s ability to navigate complex situations without error).  

2. The connections among Milbank Tweed, South Street, and Salovaara are conflicts of interest because representing both BE and its primary secured creditor (South Street) creates divided loyalties and the potential for biased advice. It could also undermine the trust and fairness required in bankruptcy proceedings. However, one could argue these are not conflicts if Milbank Tweed maintained strict ethical boundaries, though this appears unlikely.  

3. It seems irrational for an attorney with a promising career to not disclose potential conflicts, as the long-term damage to reputation and legal repercussions outweigh short-term gains. If I were in Gellene's position, I would disclose all potential conflicts to protect both my integrity and the interests of all parties involved.  

4. Stress and overwork may explain Gellene’s failure to disclose but do not excuse his actions. Ethical obligations require due diligence, regardless of workload. While stress might impair judgment, it does not absolve one of accountability.  

5. Gellene’s statement reflects overconfidence and a reluctance to admit mistakes, possibly due to fear of damaging his self-image as a competent lawyer. This mindset likely prevented him from taking corrective action when he had the chance, exacerbating the situation.  

6. The judge’s statement highlights systemic issues, such as the intense pressure and workload in legal practice, which can lead lawyers to neglect ethical considerations. It underscores the need for structural reforms to prioritize ethical behavior and reduce the likelihood of similar cases.  

7. The blame lies with both Gellene individually and the system. Gellene bears responsibility for his actions and failure to disclose conflicts, but the systemic pressures and culture within high-stakes legal environments also play a significant role in fostering unethical behavior. Structural changes are necessary to prevent such incidents in the future.
