Negotiating Bankruptcy 
 
John Gellene, a bankruptcy lawyer at the law firm Milbank Tweed, worked directly under Wall Street 
attorney Larry Lederman. In 1994, Lederman asked Gellene to represent mining equipment company 
Bucyrus-Erie (BE) in a reorganization bankruptcy that became increasingly complicated. 
 
In an attempt to initially ward off bankruptcy, BE had, pursuant to the legal advice of Milbank Tweed 
and the financial advice of Goldman Sachs, accepted a $35 million infusion of cash from an investment 
fund called South Street. In exchange, BE gave South Street a lien on all of the company’s 
manufacturing equipment, putting it ahead of other BE creditors, including Jackson National Life (JNL). 
JNL was BE’s largest single creditor, but was unsecured. BE had posted no collateral in return for JNL’s 
loan, so JNL was in line in bankruptcy court behind all of BE’s creditors that had demanded collateral. 
South Street was controlled by Mikael Salovaara, a former Goldman Sachs banker who had previously 
provided financial advice to BE and was advised by Lederman. 
 
When Gellene filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition on behalf of BE, he was required to ask the court 
to appoint him and Milbank Tweed as BE’s counsel for purposes of the proceedings. At that time, he 
filed documents under oath that were supposed to disclose any potential conflicts of interest that 
Milbank Tweed had in the proceedings.  For reasons unknown, Gellene did not disclose to the 
bankruptcy judge (who would appoint counsel) the fact that Milbank Tweed was representing both 
South Street and Salovaara regarding various matters. 
 
Legal scholars and attorneys reflecting on this case years later have speculated as to why Gellene did 
not disclose what might seem to be obvious connections that could be potential conflicts of interest for 
Milbank Tweed. Lawyer Steve Sather suggests that the lack of disclosure may have been inadvertent, 
or that Gellene did not see the connections as inherent conflicts, among other possible reasons. 
 
Regardless, Gellene did successfully guide BE through the 
reorganization process. The failure to disclose was not 
discovered until years later by JNL, which then sued Milbank 
Tweed. Criminal charges were filed against Gellene for three 
felony counts of making false statements under oath in regard 
to Milbank Tweed’s ability to serve as bankruptcy counsel. 
Gellene was convicted and sent to prison for 15 months.
