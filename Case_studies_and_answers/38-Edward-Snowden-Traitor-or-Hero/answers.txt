1) The values in conflict here are **loyalty to the government** and **public transparency**. Snowden’s actions caused potential harm to national security by disclosing sensitive information, which may have compromised government operations and endangered individuals. However, his actions also brought benefits by revealing potential abuses of power and fostering an important conversation about privacy and government surveillance. The benefits included raising awareness about the scope of government surveillance, potentially inspiring reform in policies surrounding privacy.

2) I believe Snowden’s actions were ethically **justified** despite being legally prohibited, depending on one’s perspective of the greater good. On one hand, Snowden violated legal contracts and endangered national security. However, his decision to leak the documents was made out of a belief that the government’s surveillance program violated individual rights and civil liberties. His actions highlight the moral tension between legal obligations and ethical duty to society. I would argue the higher ethical priority is informing the public about unjust practices, especially when done in the service of transparency and democracy.

3) If I were in Snowden’s position, I would likely have been torn between adhering to my legal obligations and fulfilling a moral duty to expose the truth. Ultimately, I may have made a similar decision, prioritizing the **public’s right to know** over personal consequences. While breaking the law is not something to be taken lightly, if I believed that the information disclosed was vital for public awareness and could potentially lead to systemic change, I might have chosen to disclose it despite the risks involved.

4) My position could shift if I knew that Snowden’s leak directly led to a **loss of life** among CIA operatives, as that would significantly alter the balance of moral responsibility. In this scenario, the harm caused would weigh much heavier in the ethical scale, as the loss of life is a severe consequence. However, if Snowden’s actions were proven to have led to **saving lives**, I would argue that the moral justification becomes much stronger because the harm prevented by exposing such programs might outweigh the potential legal and security repercussions.

5) Whistleblowing could be **ethically ideal** in circumstances where the public interest is endangered by systemic corruption or violation of rights, particularly when legal channels have failed to resolve the issue. A **morally prohibited** circumstance for whistleblowing might be when the leak of information has no legitimate public interest, potentially causing unnecessary harm or endangering innocent lives without contributing to a greater good.
