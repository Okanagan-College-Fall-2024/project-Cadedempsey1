Discussion Questions:
1.	What values are in conflict in this case? What harm did Snowden cause? What benefits did his actions bring?

2.	Do you agree that Snowden’s actions were ethically justified even if legally prohibited? Why or why not? Make an argument by weighing the competing values in this case.
3.	If you were in Snowden’s position, what would you have done and why?

4.	Would you change your position if you knew that Snowden’s leak would lead to a loss of life among CIA operatives? What about if it would save lives?
5.	Is there a circumstance in which you think whistleblowing would be ethically ideal? How about ethically prohibited?
