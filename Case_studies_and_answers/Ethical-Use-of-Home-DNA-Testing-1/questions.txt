Discussion Questions:

1. What happens to your DNA profile and genetic material if your testing company goes out of
business?  What should happen to it?

2. Who should have access to your genetic information? In the case of law enforcement using
consumer DNA databases, does the common good out way the individual's rights? Is there a
middle ground?

3. What right do individuals have over their DNA? If you have an identical twin, with the exact
same DNA, should dual consent be required?

4. What recourse do you have if the company’s database is hacked and your information ends up
on the internet or in criminals’ hands?

5. Does the good that flows from DNA evidence being used to bring some criminals to justice and
to exonerate wrongly-convicted people justify the invasions of privacy and other wrongs
described in this case study?
