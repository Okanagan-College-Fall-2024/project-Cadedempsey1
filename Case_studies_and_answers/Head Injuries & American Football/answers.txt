1. Many people who support the abolition or reform of football due to head trauma are also pro-choice on abortion, minor drug use, and assisted suicide, which seems contradictory because these positions typically emphasize personal autonomy. The opposition to football likely arises from a belief that the risks involved in the sport are not adequately informed or voluntary, especially when considering long-term health consequences. The apparent contradiction might stem from differing views on the moral acceptability of risks taken in the context of sports versus other areas of life. 
   a. The reverse could occur when individuals support individual liberty in sports but oppose it in cases like abortion because they believe certain risks or actions infringe on broader societal values or potential harms.

2. Society allows people to voluntarily engage in risky professions such as coal mining or being soldiers because these jobs are often seen as essential, or because the risks are generally well understood and mitigated with safety protocols. The argument against NFL players being able to take similar risks might stem from concerns about long-term health effects and the perceived unethical nature of a sport that systematically causes harm, even with informed consent.

3. Steve Almond’s argument about creating a caste of athletes for entertainment raises ethical concerns because it can be viewed as exploiting individuals for enjoyment, often at their personal expense. This can be seen as morally problematic, especially when the risks of injury are both substantial and well-documented.
   a. Fans may feel complicit in this exploitation, especially when they do not acknowledge or minimize the risks to players’ well-being. Whether fans should feel ashamed depends on their awareness and willingness to address these issues.

4. The idea of outlawing helmets to reduce head-first collisions could be a viable solution, but it also carries significant risks, including increased vulnerability to other injuries. The helmet serves as protection against skull fractures but does not prevent concussions. While this could force players to change their behavior, it would require a dramatic cultural shift in football, one that may be difficult to implement.
   a. The NFL’s resistance to outlawing helmets likely reflects concerns about tradition, the sport's identity, and the difficulty of changing practices that have long been ingrained.

5. Some argue the NFL’s approach to handling concussions is similar to the tobacco industry’s response to cancer lawsuits, in that both industries have allegedly attempted to create doubt and delay regulation to protect their financial interests. If true, this would be a moral issue, as it involves the harm of individuals for corporate gain. The morality of this could be debated based on how much responsibility corporations should bear for the well-being of participants in their industries.

6. The disproportionate representation of African-Americans in the NFL raises questions about social justice, especially considering the high injury risk involved. The criticism that the NFL is like a modern plantation suggests an exploitative system, as African-American players may not have equal agency in making decisions about their involvement in the sport.
   a. While the financial rewards for many NFL players are significant, the social justice concerns are not fully counterbalanced, as many players may face long-term health consequences. 
   b. It is unclear if safety changes would be more significant if white players dominated the NFL, but the NFL’s response might be influenced by market and media pressures.

7. The conflicting loyalties of team physicians, who have to balance the health of players with the team’s performance, raise concerns about potential ethical violations. Physicians might feel pressure to return players to the field too quickly, potentially compromising their health. 
   a. The self-serving bias could cause team physicians to minimize risks or downplay health concerns in favor of the team’s success, potentially leading to unethical decisions.

8. Mike Gundy's remarks about bringing players back for economic reasons highlight the tension between commercial interests and social welfare. This reflects how business interests often overshadow concerns about public health or player safety in sports.
   a. The parallels between Gundy’s comments about pandemic-related decisions and the debate over football’s risks reflect how economic factors often influence decisions about health, sometimes at the expense of individual well-being.

9. Requiring full disclosure of risks to college football players would ensure that they are informed about the potential long-term consequences of playing, which could help them make more educated decisions. 
   a. However, simply disclosing information may not be enough, as players may not fully grasp the potential consequences. 
   b. College and high school athletes might not always have the maturity to assess these risks accurately, making them more vulnerable to the long-term effects of the sport.

10. Whether pre-teens should play tackle football raises serious ethical questions about their welfare. While it is crucial for children to engage in activities that promote physical and mental development, the risks associated with head trauma in football may outweigh these benefits. 
    a. Allowing children to engage in dangerous play raises concerns about their ability to understand and assess risks, which could justify limiting such activities.

11. The risks involved in youth and adolescent sports might be more acceptable for adults because of their greater capacity for informed decision-making and ability to understand long-term consequences. Adolescents, however, may not have the maturity to weigh these risks appropriately.
    a. This is why the acceptable risk levels should be different for youths and adults, as their physical and psychological development differs significantly.

12. Whether to prevent kids under 14 from playing tackle football involves balancing the benefits of athletic development with the risks of long-term brain injuries. While it is essential for children to learn to assess risks, the potential for serious health consequences may justify not allowing them to play tackle football at a young age.
