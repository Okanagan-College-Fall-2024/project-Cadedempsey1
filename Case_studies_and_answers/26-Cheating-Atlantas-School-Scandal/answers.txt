1. Mr. Lewis could have been motivated by his sense of responsibility to his students, wanting to prevent them from facing the consequences of failing standardized tests, such as losing their school and community. The fear of the school's closure and the potential harm to his students' education might have rationalized his actions, leading him to focus on achieving better test scores rather than on the ethical implications of falsifying scores. Additionally, the pressure from the principal and the system of high-stakes testing may have caused moral myopia by clouding his judgment on the right course of action.

2. The stakeholders in this case study include Mr. Lewis, his students, the principal, the school administration, the school district, the community, and the educational system at large. Mr. Lewis was motivated by his desire to protect his students and the school, fearing the negative impact of failure. His students had the most at stake, as their futures and the school’s existence were directly tied to test outcomes. The principal and administrators were also involved, as they were responsible for ensuring the school met performance standards. The school district and educational policymakers were invested in maintaining good test results for accountability, and the community was concerned about the closure and its implications. Each party’s interests contributed to the pressure that influenced Mr. Lewis' actions.

3. If Mr. Lewis had decided to break away from moral myopia, he could have voiced his concerns to the principal, the school district, and his colleagues about the harmful consequences of high-stakes testing. He should have advocated for alternative assessments that better reflected student learning, rather than falsifying test results. He could have raised the issue of the ethical dilemmas of cheating in a school meeting or with educational authorities, while proposing solutions like additional support for struggling students. A public statement or whistleblowing to an independent body could have raised awareness about the issue, while focusing on systemic change rather than immediate results.

4. The benefits of falsifying test scores included improved test results, which helped to prevent the school from closing and allowed students to avoid being dispersed to other schools. This created a temporary sense of success and pride among the students, as well as an image of improvement for the school. However, the harms included the perpetuation of a flawed system of evaluation that undermined the integrity of the educational process, created unfair advantages, and eroded trust in the system. Cheating is rarely ethically justifiable, as it undermines fairness, transparency, and the long-term value of education. In this case, while the immediate impact may have seemed positive, the long-term consequences could have been damaging to the students, their education, and the educational system as a whole.

5. I have never been in a situation where I was presented with an opportunity to cheat on a test or assignment. However, if I had been, I believe I would have resisted the temptation, as I value integrity and believe that cheating undermines the purpose of learning. Looking back, I think I would have preferred to address any challenges I faced in a more honest way, either by seeking help or finding alternative solutions. Cheating might provide short-term relief, but it risks long-term consequences to personal growth and trust.
