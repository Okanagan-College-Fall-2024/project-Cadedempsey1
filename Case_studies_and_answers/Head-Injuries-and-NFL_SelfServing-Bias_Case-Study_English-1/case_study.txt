Head Injuries & The NFL 
American football is a rough and dangerous game. It features high-speed collisions between 
human beings at least one of whom is often very large. Broken bones, torn ligaments, and even 
occasional paralysis can result. But it is the research on brain injuries that has caused many 
people to claim football is immoral and to advocate that it be banned. Such calls have gained 
the attention and opposition of the National Football League (NFL) given the high popularity 
and profitability of football as a spectator sport.  
The Center for Disease Control defines a traumatic brain injury (TBI) as “a disruption in the 
normal function of the brain that can be caused by a bump, blow, or jolt to the head, or 
penetrating head injury.” A concussion is a form of TBI where the blow causes the brain to 
move rapidly back and forth, bouncing around in the skull and suffering various types of 
structural damage.  Although concussions can carry serious consequences, they are termed a 
“mild” form of TBI because they are not typically life threatening. Chronic traumatic 
encephalopathy (CTE), says the Mayo Clinic, is “brain degeneration likely caused by repeated 
head traumas.” Repetitive head impacts (RHIs) can cumulatively lead to CTE and early death, 
even though no single RHI results in a concussion.  
If only one thing is clear about the current science surrounding sports-related concussions 
(SRCs) and their related brain injuries, it’s that very little is certain about the current science. 
The field is surprisingly new. A significant scientific breakthrough occurred in 2002 when an 
African-American neuropathologist in Pittsburgh named Bennet Omalu (played by Will Smith in 
the 2015 movie Concussion) performed an autopsy on Hall of Fame center Mike Webster. Dr. 
Omalu identified abnormal clumps of the protein tau in Webster’s brain, which he believed to 
be evidence of CTE. Such proteins develop in tangles that slowly strangle neurons and, 
consequently, inhibit brain function.  
Many studies point to how dangerous football is to players’ long-term brain health. Although 
there is also research related to college players and younger, this case study focuses on the 
NFL. The studies show:  
• 
Over two regular seasons (2012-2014), NFL players sustained 4,384 injuries, including 301 
concussions. This statistic is up 61% from 2002-2007, perhaps reflecting an improvement of 
awareness and reporting (Lawrence et al. 2015).  
• 
In a study of 14,000 NFL players, 
researchers found that even head impacts 
insufficient to cause concussions can mount 
up over the years, leading to CTE and 
premature death. An NFL player who plays 
24 games increases the likelihood of 
premature death by 16% (Ehrlich et al., 
2019).

• 
A 2019 study of the brains of 223 football players with CTE and 43 players without CTE 
found that for each additional 2.6 years of play, the risk of developing CTE doubled (Mex et 
al. 2019). 
Given the results of these studies, there has been a strong outcry against football, including at 
the NFL level. The NFL initially pushed back against the implications of such research. Then, as 
evidence piled up, the NFL funded research itself about head injuries and also how to design 
safer equipment. And, the NFL made rule changes in an attempt to make the game safer. The 
NFL has also changed rules to discourage helmet-to-helmet contact, and instituted protocols for 
safely returning concussed players to the field.  
Despite these changes, controversy continues because the science in this area is not settled. 
Importantly, standard medical imaging techniques do not show brain damage even when a 
player has had a concussion. And CTE cannot truly be diagnosed until the brain is examined 
after death.  
Neuropsychologist Munro Cullum argues: “I worry the pendulum has swung too far. The reality 
is that we still don’t know who is most likely to suffer a concussion, who will take longer to 
recover, how anatomic or genetic differences influence concussions, and who may be at risk of 
prolonged symptoms or developing cognitive problems later in life.” 
Some studies seem to indicate that concussions may be more benign than feared. For example: 
• A 2016 study found no elevated risk of suicide in a population of players with at least 
five years in the league (Lehman et al., 2016).  
• Another study of 35 former NFL players over age 50 who had sustained multiple 
concussions during their careers found no significant association between the length 
of careers, the number of concussions, and their level of cognitive function later in 
life (Mez et al., 2019).  
• A 2007 study found that retired NFL players experienced levels of depressive 
symptoms no worse than those of the general population (Schwenk, 2007). 
So, at the end of the day, the jury still seems to be out on the question of whether or not we 
can go to a football game or watch one on television and still feel good about ourselves for 
supporting a sport that arguably causes irreversible traumatic brain injuries.
