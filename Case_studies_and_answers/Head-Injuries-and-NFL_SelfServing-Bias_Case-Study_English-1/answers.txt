1. Yes, my assessment of these results is affected by the fact that the brains studied were not randomly selected. Since these brains were donated by family members of players who had already exhibited adverse symptoms, the sample is inherently biased. It represents players who may have been more severely affected by CTE, which skews the findings. This selection bias means that the results are not reflective of all retired NFL players, but rather a subset of those who were symptomatic or showed visible signs of brain damage before their death. This makes it difficult to generalize the findings to all NFL players.

2. I find this study less persuasive than the previous one due to the small sample size. With only 21 participants, the results lack the statistical power and generalizability that would be provided by a larger, more diverse sample.  
   a. Yes, my mind would change if I learned the study was funded by a foundation set up by the founder and long-time owner of the Buffalo Bills. This could introduce potential biases in the research process, especially if there was any influence on the study's design or interpretation of results to avoid negative findings that could affect the reputation of the team or the sport.  
   b. The self-serving bias likely affects the assessment because both the foundation and the researchers may have a subconscious desire to produce favorable outcomes, such as minimizing the perceived risk of dementia, which could affect the credibility of the findings.  
   c. Even if the foundation had no direct involvement in the research process, there could still be an underlying pressure on the scientists to produce favorable results, especially if the foundation has the power to influence future funding opportunities. This subtle influence might result in unconscious bias.  

3. Given the self-serving bias present in the Concussion in Sport Group (CISG) due to its connections with sports organizations like the NFL, I would be cautious about fully trusting the CISG's consensus statements. The potential conflicts of interest could lead to research outcomes that downplay the risks associated with concussions to protect the interests of the sports organizations that fund or support the CISG.  
   a. Yes, my opinion would be affected by the fact that the lead author of the Casper article has been hired as an expert witness for plaintiffs. This could introduce bias into the author's perspective, as their personal involvement in litigation may color their interpretation of the CISG’s standards, making it harder to evaluate the objectivity of the article.  

4. The self-serving bias likely influences team physicians and trainers because their judgments could be shaped by the pressure to return players to the field quickly in order to help the team win. This could lead to minimizing the risks associated with injuries like concussions, compromising the players' long-term health for short-term team success.  
   b. Yes, there is a clear conflict of interest. The medical staff have an obligation to prioritize the players' health, but they also face pressures to support the team's competitive success. This dual loyalty can cloud their decision-making, especially if there is pressure from team management to clear players for return to play before they are fully recovered.

5. Yes, such conduct is somewhat inevitable when the stakes are high, as seen with the NFL's influence on research. When large financial and reputational stakes are involved, organizations may be motivated to control the narrative or suppress findings that could harm their interests.  
   c. Researchers can guard against undue influence by adhering to strict ethical guidelines, maintaining transparency in their methods and funding sources, and seeking peer review from independent experts. Ensuring the integrity of the research process and avoiding conflicts of interest is crucial to maintaining objectivity and credibility.

6. It is plausible that the media's portrayal of concussions and CTE could be influenced by a conflict of interest. Media outlets are driven by the need to attract attention and sell subscriptions, and sensationalizing the dangers of concussions may help achieve this. However, this conflict could lead to an overemphasis on certain aspects of the issue, potentially distorting the public’s understanding of the risks involved in football.

7. Other behavioral ethics biases that might be at play include role morality, where people in certain roles (e.g., NFL officials, doctors, media) may feel compelled to act in ways that align with their professional identity or the expectations of their roles. Overconfidence bias may lead individuals to underestimate the risks of concussions or CTE, believing that they understand the science better than they actually do. Framing effects could influence how information about concussions is presented, making it seem less severe or more controversial than it is. Lastly, loss aversion might cause stakeholders to downplay the risks of concussion in order to avoid the significant loss of revenue or fan support that could result from a backlash against football.
