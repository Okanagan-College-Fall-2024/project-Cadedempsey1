1. The VA scandal is an example of incentive gaming because administrators manipulated the system to meet performance goals and qualify for bonuses without actually improving the quality of care. By falsifying wait times, using multiple sets of records, and excluding certain waiting periods from calculations, administrators effectively "gamed" the system to meet their targets while the real issues of delayed care persisted.

2. Performance incentives can be effective in increasing productivity if they are carefully designed to align with ethical goals and outcomes. However, they can lead to unethical behavior or unintended consequences if they focus too narrowly on metrics that can be manipulated, as seen in the VA scandal. Incentives should promote meaningful outcomes, not just the appearance of success.

3. It is the responsibility of both the people who design the incentive system and the administrators who exploit it. The designers must ensure that the incentives are structured to achieve the desired outcomes without encouraging manipulation, while the administrators have an ethical duty to uphold the integrity of the system and not engage in dishonest practices to meet performance targets.

4. To avoid abuses in the case of the VA, incentives should be tied to comprehensive, transparent metrics that are harder to manipulate, such as quality of care, patient satisfaction, and actual wait times. Additionally, periodic audits, clear guidelines for reporting, and accountability at all levels of administration could help prevent incentive gaming.

5. Another example of incentive gaming is the case of financial institutions that offered bonuses to employees for securing high volumes of mortgage loans, which led to risky lending practices and the 2008 financial crisis. In this case, the incentives (high commissions for loan officers) encouraged risky behavior, such as approving loans that borrowers could not afford, leading to long-term financial instability.
