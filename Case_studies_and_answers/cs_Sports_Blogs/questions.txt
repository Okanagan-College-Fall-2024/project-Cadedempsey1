Discussion Questions:

1.	Did Deadspin and Daulerio do the right thing in running this story?

2.	Should Daulerio have named Sterger in the Deadspin story? Why or why not?

3.	What are the differences between traditional journalism and sports blogging? Are there different ethical guidelines that each should follow?

4.	Should journalists pay sources for information? Does it matter if the source is taking a risk by giving this information, or if the information is very important?

5.	If you were ESPN or a sports editor at a major newspaper, and Sterger came to you with this story, how might you deal with it? Would you run it as is? What else might you do, and why?
