1. Deadspin and Daulerio did not necessarily do the right thing in running this story. While the public's interest in the scandal and the story's potential for high traffic may have justified its publication, the ethical concerns about paying for information, violating confidentiality, and reporting potentially harmful rumors without solid evidence suggest that the decision to run the story was questionable from a journalistic ethics standpoint.

2. Daulerio should not have named Sterger in the Deadspin story. Sterger had asked for confidentiality due to concerns about her career, and Daulerio's decision to disregard her request undermined the trust between journalist and source. By naming her without explicit permission, he violated ethical principles regarding privacy and the protection of sources, particularly when the source expressed a desire for anonymity.

3. Traditional journalism and sports blogging differ in their approach, mission, and ethical guidelines. Traditional journalism typically adheres to strict ethical guidelines focused on verifying information, protecting sources, and maintaining impartiality. In contrast, sports blogs like Deadspin may prioritize traffic generation and sensationalism over careful fact-checking or protecting sources. While both forms of journalism are responsible for ensuring truthfulness, sports blogs may have looser standards, particularly when it comes to gossip and sensational topics, whereas traditional journalism emphasizes accountability and the careful presentation of facts.

4. Journalists should generally avoid paying sources for information, as this can lead to biased reporting or encourage sources to embellish or fabricate details for financial gain. The practice of paying sources can also compromise the integrity of the story and the journalist’s independence. However, if the source is taking significant personal or professional risks by providing information, such as exposing serious wrongdoing, the ethical considerations might shift. In such cases, paying for information may be justifiable to ensure the story is told while still considering the potential impact on the source.

5. If I were ESPN or a sports editor at a major newspaper, I would approach the story with greater caution. I would not run it as is due to the lack of concrete evidence, the potential harm to Sterger’s career, and the questionable ethics surrounding how the information was obtained. I would likely conduct my own investigation to verify the claims, respect Sterger’s privacy, and assess whether the story was newsworthy and relevant to the public. Additionally, I would consider consulting legal and ethical guidelines to determine whether publishing the story could harm the reputation of the outlet or the individuals involved.
