1. The parents involved in the Varsity Blues scandal were motivated by their deep desire to ensure their children’s success and happiness. While most led honorable lives, the pressure to fulfill their role as loving parents may have led them to believe that breaking ethical norms was justifiable. Role morality likely played a significant part, as these parents compartmentalized their actions under the guise of protecting their children, separating these decisions from their usual ethical standards. They may have seen this as a necessary act of devotion, rather than an outright moral failing, because their primary concern was shielding their children from failure and disappointment.

2.Jane Buckingham's thought process of doing "whatever she could" to help her son aligns with the mindset of a devoted parent, but it also reveals a distorted interpretation of parental love. While her intent was grounded in care for her child, her actions demonstrate a failure to balance devotion with ethical responsibility. True parental devotion involves preparing children to face challenges and setbacks, not circumventing obstacles through dishonest means.

3. The experimental results align closely with the facts of the Varsity Blues scandal. Parents like those involved in the scandal were willing to cheat when it benefited their children and the children were not present to observe. This mirrors the finding that parents prioritize their children's success even at the expense of modeling ethical behavior. The secrecy surrounding the parents' actions highlights their desire to shield their children from both the truth and its moral implications, reinforcing the experimental conclusion.

4. Levitt’s insights into role morality illuminate the contradictions in the behavior of individuals like Gordie Caplan and Douglas Hodge. In their professional lives, they adhered to high ethical standards, but their roles as parents led them to adopt a different moral framework. This shift likely occurred unconsciously, as they prioritized their children's success over their usual values. Role morality explains how the same person can embody integrity in one context and engage in unethical behavior in another, depending on the hat they are wearing at the time.

5. Both Adoboli and Buckingham used their respective roles to rationalize unethical actions. Adoboli viewed his unauthorized trades as acts of loyalty to his employer, while Buckingham justified her actions as necessary for her child’s success. In both cases, their roles provided a framework for self-justification, allowing them to minimize the moral weight of their actions. This rationalization enabled them to perceive their decisions as solutions to pressing problems rather than deliberate violations of ethical norms.

6. Parents may have told themselves they were acting solely to protect their children from disappointment, but they were likely also motivated by their own desire to avoid embarrassment and gain the social prestige associated with their children’s acceptance into elite schools. Self-serving bias likely influenced their justifications, as they framed their actions as purely altruistic. While role morality was a significant factor, the self-serving bias likely amplified their ability to rationalize unethical behavior by aligning their personal and parental interests.

7. Framing played a substantial role in the parents’ decision-making. Their overwhelming focus on achieving their desired outcome—securing college admissions for their children—caused them to disregard the moral implications of their actions. This narrow framing excluded considerations of fairness, honesty, and the broader impact on society, reducing their ethical decision-making to a transactional process aimed solely at achieving their goal.

8. Singer’s framing of college admissions as a corrupt system where connections and money determine outcomes likely contributed to the parents’ willingness to participate in the scheme. This perception created a conformity bias, where the parents may have believed their actions were part of an accepted norm. By normalizing unethical behavior as something "everyone does," Singer reduced the moral barriers for parents, making bribery and fraud appear less egregious.
