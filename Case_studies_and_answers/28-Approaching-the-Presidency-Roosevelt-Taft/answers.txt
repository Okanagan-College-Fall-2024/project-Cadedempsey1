1. Roosevelt believed his duty was to do whatever was needed for the nation, even if it meant pushing legal boundaries, while Taft believed in strictly adhering to the Constitution and legal grants of power.
2. Roosevelt often stretched the limits of executive power based on what he felt was right for the people, whereas Taft focused on following legal frameworks and only acting within explicit constitutional authority.
3. Roosevelt demonstrated more overconfidence bias, as he frequently acted on his belief in doing what he felt was best for the country, disregarding legal constraints, while Taft took a more cautious, evidence-based approach.
4. Roosevelt's informal agreement with U.S. Steel could have caused harm by not addressing potential monopolistic practices, while Taft violated the agreement in a more formal and legalistic manner, potentially harming the relationship and undermining Roosevelt’s authority.
5. Taft’s approach seems preferable as it relies on legal authority and checks and balances, ensuring actions are grounded in law. Roosevelt’s approach, though bold, risks overreach and lack of accountability.
6. An example of a leader similar to Roosevelt’s approach might be Vladimir Putin, who often acts unilaterally and makes decisions based on what he perceives as beneficial for the nation, sometimes bypassing legal constraints. This has led to more centralized power but also controversies around legality and ethics.
