Discussion Questions:

1.	Lawmakers might argue that they were creating a more pluralistic society by banning all forms of religious expression in public places, whereas detractors might argue that the ban does just the opposite. Which side do you agree with, and why?
2.	Should all religious practices be tolerated in a free society? Are there limits to what you think should be allowed? Explain your reasoning.
 
3.	Do you think your home country should implement a ban on face coverings in public? Why or why not?
4.	Should religious garments and iconography from all faith traditions be banned in public schools as occurred in France in 2004? Why or why not?

5.	According to some accounts, the law inspired instances of people acting violently against women who continued to wear burkas. Do the principles of separation of church and state and the emancipation of women outweigh these consequences? Defend your position.
