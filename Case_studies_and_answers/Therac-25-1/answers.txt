1. The errors in a medical device should be the responsibility of the entire development team, including the designers, engineers, programmers, testers, and the organization as a whole. Accountability should also extend to regulatory bodies that approve and oversee the use of such devices.

2. Creators of software have a moral responsibility to anticipate and mitigate potential adverse consequences of flaws in their products. This includes conducting rigorous testing, being transparent about known limitations, and actively responding to reported issues.

3. Software creators are morally required to implement robust quality assurance practices, such as comprehensive testing, peer reviews, and simulations under real-world conditions. They must also maintain clear documentation, follow established safety standards, and be willing to halt distribution when significant flaws are identified.

4. FDA approval of a medical device should balance benefit and harm, ensuring the device meets rigorous safety standards without stifling innovation. While 100% safety may be unrealistic, acceptable risk levels should be clearly defined, especially for novel therapies. Special considerations should apply for vulnerable populations, emphasizing both ethical and safety concerns.

5. Updated medical devices should be reviewed based on the extent of changes. Minor improvements may not require a full review, but substantial modifications or entirely new features should undergo comprehensive evaluation. This distinction ensures safety without discouraging innovation, but clear criteria must define when a full review is necessary to maintain public trust.
