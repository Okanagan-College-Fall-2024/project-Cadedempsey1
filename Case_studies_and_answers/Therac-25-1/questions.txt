Discussion Questions:

1. Who should be responsible for the errors in a medical device?

2. What moral responsibility do creators of software have for the adverse consequences that flow
from flaws in that software?

3. What steps are creators of software morally required to take to minimize the risk that they will
sell flawed software with dangerous consequences?

4. What should constitute FDA approval of a medical device? Should the benefit outweigh the
harm? Should the device be 100% safe prior to approval? Should FDA approval guidelines take
into consideration novel therapies for protected populations such as children or patients with
rare conditions?

5. Should updated medical devices be reviewed by the FDA as a new device or as an improvement
in an older design? If reviewed as an improvement, at what point can/should a device be
subject to a full review process? If reviewed as a novel device, how might this effect the
production of modified/ improved devices and the overall companies that produce medical
devices?
