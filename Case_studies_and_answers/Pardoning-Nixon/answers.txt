1. **Ford's process of moral analysis** in this situation appears to have been motivated by a combination of pragmatic and ethical considerations. He sought to heal a divided nation, prioritize national issues, and restore trust in the executive branch. Ford likely believed that continuing the Watergate investigations and focusing on Nixon’s actions would detract from addressing pressing national problems like the end of the Vietnam War. He also took into account Nixon's deteriorating health, which might have led him to think that pardoning Nixon was the more compassionate and practical choice. Ford’s moral analysis likely balanced concerns of justice, national healing, and the potential consequences of further divisiveness.

2. **Should Nixon have been held accountable?** Many argue that Nixon should have been held accountable for his actions regardless of his health or the needs of the new administration. The idea is that no one, including a president, should be above the law. Accountability is seen as crucial for justice and the integrity of the political system. On the other hand, others might argue that while accountability is important, there could be mitigating factors like the potential for national unrest or Nixon’s health that could justify a more lenient approach, though this would come at the expense of full justice.

3. **Was Ford’s decision justified on ethical grounds?** Whether Ford's decision was justified ethically depends on one's perspective. From a consequentialist viewpoint, Ford may have believed that pardoning Nixon was in the best interest of the nation, allowing for a quicker national recovery and preventing further division. However, from a deontological perspective, Ford’s decision could be seen as unethical because it allowed Nixon to escape accountability for his actions, undermining the rule of law and possibly setting a dangerous precedent for future political leaders. It is a tough ethical dilemma where the costs of justice might conflict with the perceived benefits of moving forward.

4. **Alternatives to pardoning Nixon** could have included allowing the legal system to proceed with investigations and trials, regardless of Nixon’s health. This might have held Nixon accountable in a public and legal way, restoring public trust in the system. Another option could have been offering a plea deal, which could have led to Nixon's admission of guilt without full prosecution, allowing some form of justice without dragging the nation through a prolonged trial. Ford could have also waited longer before deciding, allowing Nixon’s health to improve and considering whether any consequences could be less severe.

5. **If I were in Ford’s position,** I would have carefully weighed the long-term consequences of both options. My moral analysis would focus on justice, accountability, and the public’s trust in the system. I would have considered the severity of Nixon’s actions and the importance of holding leaders accountable, but also taken into account the need for national unity and stability. If I were to pardon Nixon, I would seek a transparent rationale for the decision, such as the potential for national healing or the desire to avoid further division. The key process would involve considering both justice and the broader societal good, while maintaining respect for the rule of law.
