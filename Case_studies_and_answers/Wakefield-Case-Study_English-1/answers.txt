1. Wakefield's financial incentives and undisclosed conflicts of interest illustrate how personal motives can undermine professional responsibilities, creating distrust and significant societal harm, including vaccine hesitancy.

2. Factors such as fame, wealth, and career advancement often influence decision-making in academia, where publication pressures and funding dependencies can tempt researchers to compromise ethics.

3. Wakefield's actions, including selectively favoring data aligning with his theory and dismissing contradicting evidence, demonstrate self-serving bias driven by personal gain and ambition.

4. Evidence of confirmation bias is clear: Wakefield and his team disproportionately emphasized data supporting the MMR-autism link while ignoring contradictory findings, skewing the study's integrity.

5. Nick Chadwick's observations, supported by testimony from colleagues and detractors, confirm Wakefield's selective interpretation of data, further exemplifying confirmation bias.

6. To mitigate subconscious bias in professional work, fostering transparency, peer review, and adherence to replicable methods is essential, alongside actively seeking and considering disconfirming evidence.

7. Self-awareness, adherence to ethical standards, and fostering a collaborative, critical research environment can help counteract biases, though maintaining vigilance against unconscious influences remains a continuous challenge.

8. Overconfidence bias likely fueled Wakefieldâ€™s belief in his theory despite his lack of qualifications in related fields, aligning with Brian Deer's characterization of his career trajectory.

9. Strategic exaggeration and moral licensing can be countered by institutional checks, such as independent reviews, and cultivating a culture of accountability, emphasizing outcomes over personal rewards.

10. Researchers may rationalize ethical lapses as necessary sacrifices to reveal perceived truths, using ends-justify-the-means logic or claiming urgency to bypass protocols.

11. Wakefield's prior public commitments to his theory and financial dependency on litigation incentives likely made retraction psychologically and financially difficult, reinforcing Brian Deer's assertions.

12. Wakefield's extensive misreporting and calculated omissions suggest deliberate intent rather than incompetence, as supported by The Lancet's editorial board and Brian Deer's findings.

13. Wakefield's disregard for disclosure norms and refusal to retract reflect a blend of intentional fraud and cognitive biases, amplified by personal ambition and external pressures.
