1. If your coach orders you to use an illegal bat or to play aggressively in a way that might injure an opposing player, you might be more likely to cross the line due to **obedience to authority**. People tend to follow instructions from authority figures, such as coaches, because they want to please them and comply with their directives, even if those actions are unethical.

2.  You may be more likely to speed if other drivers around you are speeding because of the **conformity bias**. This bias leads us to take our cues for proper behavior from the actions of others in social situations. Similarly, if your teammates are cutting corners by running fewer laps, you might be more likely to do the same.

3.  If the close call went in your team's favor, you are more likely to think the referee got it right due to the **self-serving bias**. This bias causes individuals to interpret situations in ways that benefit their own interests or group. If the call went against your team, you might be more likely to protest, viewing the decision as unfair because it negatively impacted you.

4. You might wonder whether the higher seed suffered from overconfidence because **overconfidence bias** often leads individuals to underestimate challenges and become overconfident in their abilities. This bias could also relate to your own moral decision-making, where you might overestimate your ability to make ethical choices and overlook potential missteps.

5. You may regret tripping the runner later because in the moment, the desire to win overpowers ethical concerns, which is a result of **framing**. In a high-stakes situation like a game-deciding moment, your focus on winning might cloud your judgment, but after the fact, when the ethical implications are clearer, you might experience regret.

6. If you were tempted to gradually increase the amount of money you claimed for meal reimbursements, that would be an example of **incrementalism**. This bias involves small, seemingly harmless ethical violations that build up over time, making larger unethical actions easier to justify as the line becomes blurred.

7.If you were tempted to hand over the playbook to your new team, this would demonstrate **role morality**. In your new role as a player for Team B, you might feel that your loyalty to your new team justifies actions that would otherwise be considered unethical, like sharing confidential information from your previous team.

8.  You might look at the match from a **loss aversion** perspective, focusing more on the potential loss of your undefeated record rather than the usual goal of winning. This shift in perspective could make you more tempted to miscall a shot in order to protect your record, as avoiding a loss feels more painful than the joy of winning.

9. If you find it easier to cut the new infielder from the roster, it could be an example of the **tangible & abstract** bias. Because the new player is a stranger to you, the decision to cut them might feel less personal than cutting a player with whom youâ€™ve built a relationship, making it easier to prioritize the immediate concern of roster limits over the ethical implications.
