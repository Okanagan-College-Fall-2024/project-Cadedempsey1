1) The Gaye family should not own the rights to the overall "feel" of Got to Give It Up, as this would overly restrict artistic freedom. While Gaye's song undoubtedly influenced Thicke and Williams, granting copyright to a general vibe or feel of a song could lead to an unsustainable monopolization of musical expression. It is important to distinguish between using someone's music for inspiration and directly copying specific elements of a song such as lyrics, melody, or harmony, which should be protected by copyright.

2) **Sampling** involves taking a portion of an existing song, usually in a way that is explicitly clear and legally approved, for inclusion in a new composition. **Appropriation** refers to using an artist’s original work in a transformative way, possibly altering its meaning or context for artistic purposes. **Stealing** occurs when a song or parts of it are taken without permission, typically without sufficient transformation, violating the original creator's intellectual property rights. The key distinction lies in the level of permission and transformation involved in the process.

3) Legal protections for artists are important, but it is also essential to balance them with the need for **artistic freedom**. If legal restrictions become too stringent, they could stifle creativity and prevent the incorporation of existing music into new works. However, intellectual property laws help protect the labor and original contributions of artists. The challenge lies in finding a balance that incentivizes creation while still allowing new artists to be influenced by past works without fear of excessive litigation.

4) Artists should **acknowledge significant influences** on their work to foster transparency and give credit to the original creators. While it may not be legally required to cite every single influence, **ethically**, recognizing the contributions of others respects the creative community. Acknowledging influence helps contextualize a new work and can add depth to the artistic conversation. However, the degree of influence should be considered, and full disclosure may not always be necessary for minor inspirations.

5) Ethically, listeners are not obligated to stop listening to a song if they discover it appropriates earlier work. The onus falls on the creators to disclose any legal issues, and it is primarily a matter of copyright law rather than consumer behavior. However, ethically, a listener may feel uncomfortable if they believe the song’s creators have infringed on another artist’s work, depending on the extent of the appropriation. The ethical responsibility is more about the creators’ actions than the consumer's enjoyment of the product.
