1. The overconfidence bias could explain why Briles, Starr, and McCaw made poor decisions despite their admirable character. Their confidence in their own integrity and religious values may have led them to assume they were doing the right thing, even when their actions suggested otherwise. Their self-assurance might have shielded them from fully examining the severity of their actions and led them to dismiss complaints as less important in favor of maintaining their success. Their confidence could have clouded their ability to recognize the ethical violations they were enabling.

2. a. Yes, there is evidence in the Baylor situation that the individuals involved overestimated their ethicality. They were confident in their moral character as Christian leaders, but they rationalized overlooking serious misconduct. For instance, Briles claimed ignorance of the violations despite evidence showing he knew about the complaints. b. In my own life, I've had moments of overestimating my ethical choices, such as justifying small actions I later regretted. c. I do feel confident in my moral character, but itâ€™s important to question that confidence when reflecting on past actions. d. I have made decisions that in retrospect appear unethical, and I can see how the overconfidence bias might have influenced some of those choices by leading me to ignore warning signs.

3. Yes, ethical fading may have played a role. Briles, Starr, and McCaw focused on the success of the football team and the material benefits it brought to the school, which led them to overlook or downplay the ethical implications of the misconduct within their program. Their goal-oriented mindset, focused on athletic success and its financial rewards, gradually overshadowed their moral responsibilities, making it easier for them to dismiss the severity of the issues at hand.

4. Conflicts of interest, such as prioritizing football success over the safety of female students, can lead to poor ethical decisions. The leadership at Baylor was deeply invested in the football program and its associated benefits, such as fame, donations, and new infrastructure. This self-interest may have led them to minimize the importance of addressing the wrongdoing by football players and deflect attention away from the needs of the victims. Their focus on protecting the football team's success resulted in overlooking the welfare of the students and ultimately compromising their ethical duties.

5. Moral licensing could have played a role in the Baylor scandal. The coaches, including Briles, were celebrated for their success and Christian values, which may have given them a sense of moral superiority. This self-perception may have led them to justify overlooking ethical violations, thinking that their past successes excused any wrongdoing. They believed their positive actions had "earned" the right to ignore or mishandle misconduct. I have been guilty of moral licensing at times, where success or good deeds have led me to feel I can justify minor ethical missteps.

6. The concept of altruistic cheating might explain how Briles and others rationalized their actions. They may have seen themselves as giving troubled players another chance, believing that their second-chance philosophy was justified by the goal of helping the athletes. This could be seen as an altruistic approach to cheating, where the intended help for the players took precedence over ethical conduct. In this case, it seems likely that altruistic cheating was involved, as Briles and other leaders probably viewed their role in helping players as outweighing the ethical concerns about ignoring their misconduct.
