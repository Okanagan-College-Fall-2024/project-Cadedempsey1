1. Ethically, it was not permissible to publish the article. While legally allowed, Hannan’s decision to reveal Vanderbilt’s transgender identity and the details of her personal life, which were not directly relevant to the putter, caused significant harm. The lack of awareness regarding trans issues and the focus on Vanderbilt’s personal life over her professional work was ethically questionable, particularly given her desire for privacy.

2. In Hannan’s position, I would have focused solely on the fraudulent claims related to Vanderbilt’s professional background, excluding her gender identity, as it did not pertain to the story. The priority should have been on the putter and the fraud, not on personal, irrelevant details that could harm someone’s life and privacy.

3. Hannan’s bias to uncover the “full truth” likely pressured him to investigate every aspect of Vanderbilt’s life, including her gender identity. He might have rationalized his actions by believing that exposing all facts, even those unrelated to the invention, was his duty as a journalist. This pressure to report comprehensively, without fully considering the potential harm, likely contributed to his decision to out Vanderbilt.

4. If I were in Simmons’ position, I would have reconsidered publishing the article, especially the details about Vanderbilt’s transgender identity. I would have consulted experts in trans issues and evaluated the ethical ramifications of exposing her personal life. The potential harm and her desire for privacy should have outweighed the journalistic urge to report every detail.

5. Simmons may have been influenced by the desire to publish a complete and sensational story. His rationale likely stemmed from the belief that withholding information, such as Vanderbilt’s past, would compromise the integrity of the article. However, the lack of sophistication and understanding of transgender issues seems to have led to a lack of awareness about the ethical implications of exposing such private details.

6. Comprehensive reporting can be balanced with respecting privacy, but it requires careful consideration of what is truly relevant to the story. In this case, Vanderbilt’s gender identity was not essential to the narrative about the putter. Journalists should assess whether revealing certain personal details serves the public interest or unnecessarily exposes vulnerable individuals to harm. Hannan, in his reflection, acknowledged the need to question if pursuing a story is worth the potential harm caused.

7. Yes, journalists do bear a special responsibility toward people who may be at risk of harm or face oppression based on their identity. Exposing private details about vulnerable groups, like transgender people, can result in significant harm, as seen in this case. Journalists should be aware of the power of their words and the impact their stories can have on marginalized individuals, weighing the potential harm against the public interest.
