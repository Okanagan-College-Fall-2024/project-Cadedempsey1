1. **Ethical decision to buy amber from Myanmar:**

   a. **Deontological approach**: If I were a university scientist taking a deontological approach, I would focus on moral principles like respect for human rights, justice, and non-exploitation. The actions of the Myanmar government in forcibly displacing civilians and funding military operations through the amber trade would violate these moral principles. From a deontological standpoint, the right course of action would be to refrain from purchasing Myanmar amber, as it directly supports human rights abuses and conflict. The principles of justice and respect for the autonomy and dignity of the people in the region would take precedence.

   b. **Utilitarian approach**: If I took a utilitarian approach, I would consider the broader consequences of purchasing Myanmar amber. I would weigh the benefits of scientific discoveries made possible by amber (such as understanding ancient organisms) against the harm caused by supporting an oppressive government and fueling a conflict. The ethical decision would depend on whether the overall consequences of buying amber result in more harm than good. If the purchase enables more research but sustains the conflict and human rights abuses, the harm could outweigh the benefits, leading to a decision not to buy.

2. **Guarding against self-serving bias**: To guard against self-serving bias, I would need to be particularly vigilant in ensuring that my decision-making process isn't influenced by personal interests (such as gaining access to valuable research material) or rationalizing actions to justify the purchase. This could be mitigated by actively seeking external advice, considering alternative sources of amber, and prioritizing ethical research practices over convenience. Reflecting on the broader ethical implications and engaging with diverse viewpoints would help ensure that my reasoning remains objective and not clouded by personal benefits.

3. **Other cognitive biases and heuristics**:
   - **Normalcy bias**: This bias might lead me to downplay the seriousness of the situation in Myanmar, assuming that things are "business as usual" and that the amber trade is not significantly contributing to harm.
   - **Conformity bias**: If other researchers or universities are purchasing Myanmar amber, I may feel pressure to follow suit, even if I recognize ethical issues, simply to avoid standing out or feeling left behind.
   - **Moral disengagement**: I might convince myself that the harm caused by purchasing Myanmar amber is minimal compared to the value of scientific progress, or that I, as an individual, cannot significantly influence the situation. This reasoning would allow me to justify unethical behavior.
   
   To avoid these biases, I would need to engage in critical thinking and seek input from others with differing perspectives to ensure a balanced ethical evaluation.

4. **Comparable situations globally**: Yes, there are other situations where buyers should be wary of purchasing goods that may indirectly support harmful practices. **Conflict minerals** in Africa (like coltan, tungsten, and tin) provide a clear example. The mining and trade of these materials have funded armed conflicts, human rights abuses, and child labor. Buyers of such minerals must consider whether their purchases contribute to such activities. This consideration should always be taken into account when there is evidence of harm, as even indirect support can perpetuate unethical actions. 

   While it may not always be obvious that a purchase is linked to harmful practices, when there is clear evidence, ethical buyers should avoid supporting these industries, and actively seek alternatives that do not fuel conflict or exploitation.

5. **Lessons from conflict minerals debate**: Scientists considering the morality of trading in Myanmar amber can learn from the debate over conflict minerals in Africa, especially regarding the ethical responsibility of buyers to ensure that their purchases do not contribute to human suffering or conflict. The **"due diligence"** approach that many companies have adopted with conflict minerals, in which they trace the supply chain to ensure that materials do not fund armed groups or cause harm, can be applied to Myanmar amber. Scientists can be proactive in ensuring that their purchases do not indirectly support government oppression or exacerbate the civil conflict. This might include looking for amber from sources that are not involved in the ongoing conflict or finding alternative ways to conduct research without contributing to the harm caused by the amber trade in Myanmar.
