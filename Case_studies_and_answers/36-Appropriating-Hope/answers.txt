Artistic appropriation can be a positive practice when it transforms and recontextualizes existing images or objects to create new meaning. It enables artists to engage with cultural artifacts in ways that challenge existing norms and generate new ideas. However, it can become problematic if artists simply reproduce the original work without adding new value or meaning. The medium can play a role in how appropriation is received. For example, digital mediums might allow for easier reproduction, while physical artwork might require more significant transformation, leading to different ethical considerations.

Appropriation is ethically questionable not just because of money or popularity, but also when an artist uses someone else's work without adequate transformation or proper permission. When appropriation is done for commercial gain or without adding significant new meaning, it can lead to exploitation. However, even when money isn't involved, taking someone else's intellectual property without regard for their rights is still problematic. The ethical concerns stem from respect for intellectual property, regardless of financial gain.

The key difference between Warhol's use of the Campbell’s soup cans and Fairey’s use of Garcia's photograph lies in the level of transformation. Warhol turned a mass-produced object into a high-art form, which was seen as a critique of consumerism and mass production, making it arguably more abstracted. Fairey’s appropriation of Garcia's photograph, however, still bore strong resemblance to the original photo, though it was reimagined to convey a radically different message. Warhol’s approach was perhaps less problematic in some ways, because his work had clearer artistic commentary on the commercial world, whereas Fairey’s use raised more issues regarding copyright and attribution, even if his transformation of the image was significant.

Fairey’s preemptive lawsuit could be seen as a legitimate maneuver to protect his rights to fair use, asserting that his work met the criteria for transformation and commentary, which is one of the guiding principles of fair use. On the other hand, it can also be viewed as an admission of potential copyright infringement, as he likely anticipated a legal dispute with The A.P. given the photo's copyright status. By filing first, Fairey preemptively protected his position in the case. Ultimately, the case settled, showing the complexity and uncertain boundaries of fair use in art.

Moral intent can be important in understanding the purpose and nature of an artistic appropriation. If the artist’s intent is to critique, celebrate, or add new meaning to the original work, it often justifies the appropriation ethically. However, what matters most in these instances is whether the new work sufficiently recontextualizes the original piece. Intent without meaningful transformation doesn't add substantial new meaning, and thus can be seen as exploitation. So, moral intent does matter, but in terms of legality and ethical legitimacy, the transformation itself often carries more weight.
