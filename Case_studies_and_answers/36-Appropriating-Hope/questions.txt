Discussion Questions:
1.	In general, do you think artistic appropriation is a positive or negative practice? Why? Does it matter what medium the artist works in?

2.	Is appropriation only ethically questionable when money or popularity are involved?
3.	What differences do you see between Warhol’s use of the Campbell’s soup cans and Fairey’s use of Garcia’s photograph? Is one less problematic than the other? Why or why not?
4.	Do you think Fairey’s preemptive lawsuit against the Associated Press was a legitimate maneuver for protecting his fair use rights or an admission of copyright infringement? Defend your position.

5.	Do you think moral intent matters in instances of artistic appropriation? Or, does it only matter whether the new work sufficiently recontextualizes the original piece?
