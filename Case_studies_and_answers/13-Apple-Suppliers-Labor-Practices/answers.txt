1. Apple should be partially responsible for ethical lapses further down its supply chain because it profits from these practices and has the resources to influence change. While it cannot directly control every aspect of its supply chain, it has a duty to enforce stricter oversight and ensure compliance with ethical standards. Consumers hold Apple accountable as it benefits from the labor that creates its products.

2. Apple should continue working with suppliers to drive changes rather than cutting ties indiscriminately. Ceasing operations with all suppliers, including ethical ones, would disrupt livelihoods and remove Apple’s leverage to improve conditions. By staying engaged, Apple can promote better practices through collaboration and monitoring.

3. Consumers should consider the ethical track records of companies when making purchases, as it encourages businesses to adopt better practices. However, not all consumers have the resources or knowledge to evaluate ethical implications, making it a shared responsibility between consumers and companies. Increased transparency from businesses can help consumers make informed decisions.

4. Brands like fast-fashion retailers and chocolate companies often rely on ethically questionable practices, such as low-wage labor or child labor. Many consumers are indifferent due to convenience, price, or lack of awareness. However, brands with poor ethical records, like H&M, have faced backlash, showing that consumer sentiment can shift with greater awareness and advocacy.

5. Knowing about ethically questionable production conditions would affect my decisions, though not always decisively. For instance, I would avoid products from companies like Nestlé, which has faced criticism over labor practices and environmental impact. However, the lack of alternatives for some products can make it challenging to act on these principles consistently.

6. As part of a third-party regulating body, I would enforce strict audits and penalties for non-compliance, as well as incentivize ethical practices through certifications and public recognition. While corporations bear significant responsibility, regulators play a crucial role in setting enforceable standards and ensuring transparency. Collaboration between regulators, companies, and consumers is essential for meaningful change.
