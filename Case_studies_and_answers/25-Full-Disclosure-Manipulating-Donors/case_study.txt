Case Study – Full Disclosure: Manipulating Donors - Page 1 of 2 
Full Disclosure: Manipulating Donors 
 
Jenny, a university student studying public relations, accepted an internship position in the fundraising 
department at Casa Tia Maria.* Casa Tia Maria is a non-profit organization in the United States that 
provides shelter for Central American immigrants while they look for permanent housing and 
employment. In addition to shelter, Casa Tia Maria provides food, clothing, and English classes.  Most 
immigrants stay at the shelter for several months before securing permanent housing. 
 
After Jenny had worked at Casa Tia Maria for two weeks, Mary, the director of development, asked 
Jenny to accompany her to a fundraising dinner at a luxurious downtown hotel. Many wealthy and 
influential individuals were in attendance. After most of the guests had left, Mary and Jenny were 
approached by Robert, a Texas oil baron and one of the state’s biggest philanthropists. Robert was 
known to donate to almost any cause as long as he found it to be what he considered “morally sound” 
and to the benefit of “hard-working Americans.”  
 
Mary and Robert talked for a few minutes about Casa Tia Maria and its specific needs. Jenny noticed, 
however, that most of Mary’s answers to Robert’s questions about the shelter’s clients were vague. 
When Robert said that he was happy to lend a hand to any poor American citizen, Jenny knew he 
clearly did not understand that immigrants, who were not U.S. citizens, were the shelter’s clientele. 
Mary said nothing to correct Robert’s misperception. 
 
Robert pulled a checkbook out of his jacket and wrote a substantial check. As he handed it to Mary, he 
said, “I am so pleased to be able to help hard-working Americans.” He then turned quickly and walked 
away.
