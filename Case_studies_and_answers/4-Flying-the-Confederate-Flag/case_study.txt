Case Study – Flying the Confederate Flag - Page 1 of 2 
Flying the Confederate Flag 
 
 
On July 9, 2015, Governor Nikki Haley signed a bill requiring the Confederate flag to be removed 
from the South Carolina State House grounds. The flag and the pole on which it was flown were both 
removed the following day. Leading up to this removal was heated debate concerning whether or not 
the Confederate flag should be taken down. Similar discussions occurred across the United States in 
places where Confederate flags or other Confederate symbols were on display, ranging from 
governmental properties and university campuses to NASCAR venues and popular television series. 
 
Prior to the flag’s official removal from the front of the South Carolina State House, police 
arrested activist Brittany Newsome for climbing the flagpole and removing the flag herself. The activist 
explained her act of defiance, stating, “because it was the right thing to do and it was time for 
somebody to step up. Do the right thing. We have to bury hate; it’s been too long.” South Carolina 
Representative Jenny Anderson Horne, an ancestor of former Confederate President Jefferson Davis, 
argued that the Confederate flag should no longer fly in front of the State House. She chastised her 
colleagues in an emotional speech, stating, “I cannot believe that we do not have the heart in this body 
to do something meaningful—such as take a symbol of hate off these grounds on Friday.” 
 
 
On the other hand, Confederate sympathizers contend that the flag is a symbol of historical 
pride, not of hatred. They claim that efforts to remove the flag are a misplaced reaction to photos of 
Dylann Roof posing with a Confederate flag. Roof had been recently charged with the racially 
motivated killing of nine black people in a Charleston church. South Carolina State Senator Lee Bright 
noted that symbols have been misused throughout history. 
Bright said, for example, that he believed the Ku Klux Klan 
abused the symbol of the cross, but there has not been a 
push to remove all crosses. Similarly, Kenneth Thrasher, the 
lieutenant commander of the Sons of the Confederate 
Veterans, urged decision makers not to act in haste because, 
“The flag didn’t kill anybody. It was a deranged young man 
who did.”
