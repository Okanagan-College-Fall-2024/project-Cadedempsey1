Discussion Questions:

1. Do you believe that flying a Confederate flag is ethically prohibited? Why or why not?
2. In what ways is displaying a Confederate flag similar or different to displaying other types of
flags? A tribal flag? A national flag? A corporate flag? A sports team flag? A rainbow flag?
3. Should retailers bow to public pressure to discontinue sales of controversial items even if they
are not illegal, such as toy guns, fur coats, or Native American headdresses?
4. Is it possible to make an objective decision in the case of the Confederate flag? How might you
come to a decision that is both reasonable and defensible?
5. Can you think of an example of another situation in which there were two views that were
strongly opposed to each other? How was the situation resolved? Do you think the ethically
ideal decision was reached? Why or why not?
