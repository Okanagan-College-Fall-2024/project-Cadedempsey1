1. Moral imagination refers to the ability to envision and understand the perspectives, needs, and ethical considerations of others when making decisions. The employees at R&R Partners exercised moral imagination by recognizing the challenges faced by the Animal Foundation and using creative strategies to raise awareness about pet adoption. Instead of focusing solely on emotional appeals about love and companionship, they reframed pet adoption in a light-hearted, practical manner, making it more relatable and engaging to a wider audience.

2. The “In-FUR-mercial” campaign provided multiple benefits: for the Animal Foundation, it helped increase pet adoptions by 9.39% in 2015, meaning over 1,000 additional animals found homes. For R&R Partners, the campaign boosted agency morale, fostered camaraderie, and enhanced the agency’s reputation as a responsible corporate citizen. It also resulted in positive press, increasing visibility for both the Animal Foundation and the Lied Shelter.

3. In this case study, moral imagination had in common with other types of creativity and innovation in that it involved thinking outside the box and developing a novel approach to a complex issue (pet overpopulation and shelter overcrowding). Like other forms of creativity, it required recognizing an existing problem, identifying a new way to engage people, and finding solutions that benefited both the organization and the community.

4. Yes, an advertising agency could exercise moral imagination when working with corporate clients that pay for services. If the agency recognizes its ability to influence positive social change through its campaigns, it could frame its strategies in ways that align with ethical considerations. For instance, an agency could help a corporate client promote sustainability, advocate for diversity, or support social causes through its advertising, all while keeping the client’s goals in mind.

5. One example of another campaign that demonstrated moral imagination is Dove’s “Real Beauty” campaign. Dove challenged conventional beauty standards by using diverse models of different ages, shapes, and ethnicities to promote self-esteem and body positivity. This campaign not only redefined beauty standards but also used advertising as a tool for social change, promoting a message of inclusivity and self-acceptance.
