1. Sports Illustrated's decision to run the Vonn photo raises ethical concerns primarily around the portrayal of female athletes. The issue is whether the photo objectifies Vonn or whether it highlights her athleticism. If the photo detracts from her skills by emphasizing her physical appearance, it could be seen as ethically problematic because it reinforces harmful gender stereotypes. The intention behind the photo matters in terms of ethics, as it determines whether the intention was to honor her athleticism or to sensationalize her image for commercial gain. If the cover did increase interest in female competitive skiing, it could make a difference ethically in that it could lead to more recognition and respect for women's sports. However, if it came at the cost of her athletic dignity, it would still be ethically troubling.

2. Defending the decision to run the Vonn photo could be based on several points. First, it may have been an artistic decision meant to present Vonn in a unique, empowering way rather than as a mere sex object. The focus could have been on showing a female athlete in a bold and distinctive pose, not necessarily to sexualize her. Second, in a publication targeting a predominantly male readership, running a visually striking cover could help attract attention to women's sports, possibly increasing their popularity and viewership. Furthermore, there are those who would argue that Vonn, as a professional athlete, has a right to present herself however she chooses, and there is nothing wrong with showcasing her attractiveness alongside her athletic accomplishments.

3. The selection of cover photos is an important decision for sports journalists because it can shape the public perception of athletes and influence the way sports are covered. While business factors certainly play a role, the ethical considerations are far from secondary. A sports publication has the power to elevate or diminish an athlete's reputation, especially when women athletes are concerned, given the history of underrepresentation and underappreciation of female athletes in the media. The decision is not purely business but involves shaping the narrative of sports and athletics, which brings up broader ethical issues about representation, objectification, and the promotion of gender equality in sports journalism.

4. If I ran Sports Illustrated, I would have carefully considered how the Vonn photo could be perceived by different audiences. My decision would have been guided by values of respecting athletes for their skills and achievements, while also recognizing that physical attractiveness and femininity are natural aspects of identity that should not diminish an athleteâ€™s professional reputation. I would ensure that the portrayal focused more on her athleticism, positioning her in a way that empowered her as both an athlete and a woman, without making her body the primary focus. Ethical decisions would center on integrity, respect for female athletes, and promoting gender equality in sports coverage.
