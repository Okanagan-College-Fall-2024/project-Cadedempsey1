1. Cheating among inspiring Paralympians may not surprise those aware of the pressures athletes face in competitive environments, where incentives to win can lead to unethical behavior. Others may be shocked, given the perception of Paralympians as embodying perseverance and fairness.

2. Paralympians may cheat to gain a competitive edge, secure financial rewards, or achieve personal or national glory, all intensified by the high stakes of international competition.

3. Psychological biases such as self-serving bias (justifying cheating for success), social pressures from coaches or teammates, and rationalizations like "everyone cheats" or "the end justifies the means" might lead athletes to cheat.

4. Cheating appears less prevalent in the Special Olympics, as it focuses on inclusion and personal achievement rather than competitive victory. The video on incentive gaming might highlight how high-stakes rewards can distort behavior, creating an environment conducive to cheating.

5. The self-serving bias can motivate both coaches and athletes to cheat by justifying actions as necessary for personal or organizational success. For example, the Spanish basketball coach might have rationalized exploiting the system as a means to elevate his career and secure funding.

6. The Spanish basketball team’s justification, citing widespread cheating as a norm, exemplifies conformity bias. This argument is largely a rationalization, as it shifts responsibility from the wrongdoers to systemic corruption.

7. The stereotype that disabled individuals exploit systems for benefits is harmful and perpetuated by these scandals. This likely wasn’t a primary concern for the cheaters, but the narrative damages the public perception of disabled people. Other impacts include eroding trust in the Paralympic system and diminishing the achievements of genuine athletes.

8. While some argue that cheating humanizes Paralympians, making them relatable, this perspective trivializes the ethical breaches involved. It undermines the integrity of sport and the values the Paralympics stand for.

9. Bethany Woodward’s decision to return her medal is admirable as it upholds the principles of fairness and integrity. While James Moore’s critique highlights the competitive aspect of sports, it dismisses the Paralympics’ unique mission of celebrating personal triumphs over disability.

10. Athletes like Woodward and Long, who expose cheating, should not "just shut up." Transparency is crucial for addressing systemic issues, even if it temporarily disrupts the sport.

11. The IPC's actions, such as banning basketball, and Australia’s online course are necessary steps toward reform. However, these measures alone may not be sufficient. Continuous oversight, stricter enforcement, and fostering a culture of ethics are needed to prevent future cheating.
