1. Yes, it is fair criticism. Despite their seemingly honorable lives, they prioritized the reputation of Penn State and its football program over the welfare of children, thus failing to act on knowledge of Sandusky’s abuse. Their decision to protect the institution led to years of further abuse and the harm of vulnerable children.

2. Yes, the bias of the tangible and the abstract likely played a significant role. The four men were heavily invested in the tangible, such as the university’s reputation and football program, while the victims were abstract figures. The lack of personal connection to the victims may have led them to devalue the harm caused and focus on the institution's image.

3. Yes, such thinking likely played a role. The men may have thought the incident was a one-time occurrence or that the victims would not come forward. This mindset kept the problem at an abstract level, as they were more focused on the potential damage to the university's image than addressing the actual harm to children.

4. a. Yes, if the Penn State Four had met Sandusky’s victims, they might have felt a stronger emotional connection and sense of responsibility, potentially leading them to take more decisive action. b. If the victims had been their own children, it is likely they would have acted differently. The personal connection would have made the abuse more tangible and morally urgent, possibly prompting them to report the crimes immediately.

5. The self-serving bias and role morality likely impacted the decisions of the men. The self-serving bias led them to protect their personal and professional interests, while role morality caused them to prioritize their roles within the university over their moral obligations to protect children. These biases likely led to a failure to act in the best interest of the victims.
