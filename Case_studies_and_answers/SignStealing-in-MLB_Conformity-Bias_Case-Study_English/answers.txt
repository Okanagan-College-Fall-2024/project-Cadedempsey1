1. The knowledge that other major teams, like the Red Sox and Yankees, had either been caught or suspected of stealing signs likely influenced the Astros’ decision to continue their actions. The rationalization of “everyone is doing it, so it must be okay” aligns with the conformity bias, where individuals or groups adjust their behaviors to match perceived norms within their environment. If significant teams like the Yankees and Red Sox were engaged in similar behaviors without severe consequences, it made it easier for the Astros to justify their actions as acceptable.

2. J.D. Davis’s statement appears to reflect the conformity bias more than a simple rationalization. As a rookie, Davis was new to the major-league culture, and his unfamiliarity with the “norms” of his team could have led him to assume that the actions taken by the Astros players were standard, especially if they were being practiced by seasoned veterans. The conformity bias can manifest when individuals conform to actions simply because they believe they are part of the accepted behavior in a group, especially when they’re uncertain or impressionable.

3. If J.D. Davis had been a seasoned veteran at the time, it may have been more difficult for him to remain passive in the scheme. Veterans are typically more confident in their role and would have a clearer understanding of what is acceptable and what isn't. Additionally, being established in the clubhouse gives one more influence, enabling them to speak out more easily if they disagree with the norm. 

4. The “code of silence” in MLB, often linked with group loyalty and protecting the team, is indeed common in some other professions, such as the military or law enforcement. This can contribute to a collective reluctance to whistleblow, which may sustain problematic behaviors. As for the conformity bias, players, despite discomfort with the scheme, might not speak out because they believe that voicing their dissent would make them stand out in an environment where silence is the expected norm. To reform this code, teams could encourage more transparent and ethical cultures, perhaps even establishing clearer channels for whistleblowing without penalizing those who choose to report unethical actions.

5. Some players who were uncomfortable with the cheating may have refrained from speaking out due to fear of backlash, personal repercussions, or the loyalty ingrained in team culture. Others may have stayed silent because they feared losing their place on the team or not being accepted by teammates. The collective pressure within the locker room and the implicit threat of being ostracized might have made it difficult for individuals to speak out against the cheating scheme, especially if they thought others were in compliance as well.

6. Donald Trump's attitude towards cheating in golf exemplifies the conformity bias in action. If he believes that everyone is cheating, he sees it as just another part of the game. This is not only rationalizing his own actions but is also rooted in a belief that the behavior is normal or expected within the group he’s involved with, hence a reflection of group norm dynamics. It may also touch on collective illusion, where the belief in widespread cheating causes an individual to believe that it’s a widespread, accepted practice, even though others might not actually agree.

7. The obedience to authority video highlights how people's actions are often influenced by those in positions of power. For the Astros, the manager and general manager held significant authority, so the players may have felt compelled to follow the “orders” to participate in the cheating scheme, even if they were uncomfortable doing so. The fear of reprimand or being ostracized within the team might have made them comply with the cheating behavior.

8. Other behavioral concepts that might have played a role include the self-serving bias and framing. The self-serving bias refers to the tendency to attribute successes to one's actions and failures to external circumstances. In the Astros’ case, players might have framed their success during the 2017 World Series as a result of their own talent, without giving due consideration to the illegitimate ways the games were won. Framing could have caused players to rationalize the cheating, viewing it as a necessary competitive edge or a harmless "strategy."
