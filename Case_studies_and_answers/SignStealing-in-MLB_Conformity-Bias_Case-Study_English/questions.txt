1. How might the fact that two of MLB’s best teams had been caught illegally sign stealing (Red
Sox) or suspected of it (Yankees) affected the Astros? Is “if everyone is doing it, it must be okay”
a rationalization that is consistent with the conformity bias? Explain.
2. Former Astro J.D. Davis later explained: “I was a rookie, and I was going up and down the
system, and I was fighting for my life. … As a 24-year-old at the time, I was pretty star-struck at
the time being around some of the veteran guys and being around the big-league clubhouse
and everything. I had never been part of a major-league clubhouse. Maybe what they did was
the norm, I have no idea. I had never been in another big-league clubhouse.” Does this sound
like the conformity bias in action, or just another rationalization? What do you think and why?
3. If J.D. Davis in the previous question had been a seasoned veteran, would it have been easier
for him to “just say no” to the scheme? Explain.
1. Would it have been easy? Why or why not?
4. Although some MLB players lauded Mike Fiers for coming forward about the scandal, others
criticized him for allegedly violating baseball’s “code of silence” (also called the “clubhouse
code.”) Is that code common in professions or organizations other than MLB (and the Mafia)?
1. Is it part of the problem? Why or why not?
2. Is it a manifestation of the conformity bias? If so, how?
3. How might this code be reformed or even ended?There were clearly Astros players who
were uncomfortable with the cheating. Why didn’t they speak out? What about the
Astros players, other than Fiers, who left the club knowing of the scheme, but never
reported it? Why didn’t they speak out?
5. There were clearly Astros players who were uncomfortable with the cheating. Why didn’t they
speak out? What about the Astros players, other than Fiers, who left the club knowing of the
scheme, but never reported it? Why didn’t they speak out?
6. It has been widely reported that former President Trump is a notorious cheater when he plays
golf. As reported in Rick Reilly’s book:
“I played with him once,’ says Bryan Marsal, longtime Wingfoot member and chair of the
coming 2020 Men’s U.S. Open. ‘It was a Saturday morning game. We go to the first tee and he
couldn’t have been nicer. But then he said: ‘You see those two guys? They cheat. See me? I
cheat. And I expect you to cheat because we’re going to beat those two guys today.’ So, yes, it’s
true, he’s going to cheat you. But I think Donald, in his heart of hearts, believes that you’re
gonna cheat him, too. So if it’s the same, if everybody’s cheating, he doesn’t see it as really
cheating.

1. Does this sound like the conformity bias in action? Explain.
2. Does it sound like the collective illusion concept, which describes how people in a group
go along with an idea that they don’t agree with simply because they believe
(incorrectly) that most people in the group agree with that idea? Explain.
7. As the Obedience to Authority video in this series explains, people’s tendency to want to please
people in a position of authority also played a role in the Astros’ sign-stealing behavior.
Describe how.
8. What other behavioral concepts studied in this series might also have played a role? For
example, did the self-serving bias play a role? Explain. How about framing? Explain.
