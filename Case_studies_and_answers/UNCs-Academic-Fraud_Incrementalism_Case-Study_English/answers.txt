1. Incrementalism played a key role in the UNC academic fraud. Initially, creating a single paper course may have seemed like a minor deviation, but over time, this small exception became normalized. As more student-athletes were directed toward these courses, the fraudulent practice expanded, eventually becoming an institutionalized process.

2. Faculty and staff might have supported or ignored these paper courses to ensure student-athletes remained eligible, preserving their jobs or the university's athletic success. Students likely took these classes to maintain eligibility or reduce academic pressures. Making exceptions for a few student-athletes created a precedent, which encouraged others to seek similar advantages, leading to a systemic issue.

3. It would indeed be difficult to deny additional student-athletes similar opportunities once exceptions were made for others. This creates a precedent, fostering a sense of entitlement among other athletes and making it harder for staff to refuse future requests.

4. Denying non-athletes access to these courses could be equally challenging. Once such courses existed, restricting them to athletes alone would appear discriminatory. This could lead to further ethical dilemmas and potential scrutiny, making the practice difficult to contain.

5. If asked to create hundreds of fake courses initially, it’s unlikely that Nyang’oro and Crowder would have agreed. Such a large-scale request would have been daunting and blatantly unethical from the outset. However, the gradual expansion of the scheme made it easier for them to rationalize their actions over time.

6. Southall’s argument about the unrealistic balance between academics and athletics for Division I student-athletes is valid. Demanding full-time athletic commitment while expecting academic success is contradictory, especially for students with limited academic preparedness. Universities need to reconsider their approach to ensure realistic expectations.

7. Major universities have a responsibility to support student-athletes in achieving both academic and athletic success. They should provide adequate resources, such as tutoring and flexible schedules, without compromising academic integrity. Striking this balance requires prioritizing the education and long-term well-being of student-athletes.

8. If aware of academic fraud at your own institution, the response would depend on the university's culture and policies. Institutions committed to integrity typically address such issues through audits, disciplinary action, and transparent reforms.

9. The UNC case parallels accounting frauds, which often begin with small, seemingly insignificant breaches. Over time, these minor infractions grow as individuals become desensitized to unethical practices, eventually leading to systemic failures.

10. The quote by Scott London aligns with the UNC case. Once the fraudulent courses were established and appeared successful without consequences, it became easier for the involved parties to continue and expand the practice, lowering their ethical standards.

11. The UNC staff likely experienced desensitization through routinization. Initially uncomfortable with the fraudulent system, over time, the repetitive nature of their actions normalized unethical behavior, making it feel routine and reducing moral conflict.
