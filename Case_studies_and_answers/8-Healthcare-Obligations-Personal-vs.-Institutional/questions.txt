Discussion Questions:

1. Do you think Dr. Jones should discuss her reservations about flu vaccines with her senior
patients? Why or why not?

2. Do you think Dr. Jones has a greater moral obligation to her family to protect her job security or
to the recommendations of the AMA Code of Ethics, which encourage physicians to help
patients exercise their “right of self-decision” by providing them with enough information to
enable an informed choice? Explain your reasoning.

3. Even if flu shots provide protection less than one fourth of the time, is it ethically permissible
for Dr. Jones to decide that protection for some patients is better than none? And, on that
basis, decide not to discuss the potential benefits and harms of flu shots with her patients?
Explain.

4. Do you think the AMA should promote open discussions about the efficacy of flu vaccines and
support the development of blood tests that could predict that efficacy? Why or why not?
What are the potential outcomes?

5. Both the AMA Code of Ethics and the World Health Organization endorse the primary “right of
self-decision” of all patients regarding their health care. However, to foster “herd immunity,”
the bill SB 277 was recently passed in the state of California, mandating multiple doses of
vaccinations for all students entering kindergarten. Do you think there is a way to reconcile
these two opposing ethical goals? Explain.
