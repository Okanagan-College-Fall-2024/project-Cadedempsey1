1. Role morality is evident in Kim Davis' case, as she prioritized her personal religious beliefs over her professional duty as a government official to issue marriage licenses. Role morality would not be ethically permissible in this situation because public officials have a duty to uphold the law regardless of personal beliefs.
2. Role morality is evident in the case of the social worker, as his religious beliefs about homosexuality might interfere with his professional duty to provide unbiased care. Role morality would not be ethically permissible here because the social worker has a duty to separate personal beliefs from professional responsibilities to ensure unbiased, effective care.
3. Mental health providers should not be able to decline services to individuals based on lifestyle choices they find morally wrong. Clinicians should prioritize their duty to provide care to all individuals, regardless of personal beliefs, as refusing care based on values undermines professional ethics and can perpetuate harm.
4. It is not fair to a client if a social worker harbors animosity toward the client based on their sexual orientation, as it could affect the quality and objectivity of care. The client would likely be better served by a clinician who does not harbor such beliefs to ensure a safe, supportive, and nonjudgmental therapeutic environment.
5. Clients should not be asked to identify their sexual orientation upon admission, as it can risk the client’s privacy and trust. If a transfer is made after the client’s disclosure, it could cause harm due to a disruption in care. However, it is also risky to continue with a clinician who has antipathy toward the client’s sexual orientation, as this could harm the therapeutic relationship.
6. If referral to another therapist is not possible due to staffing limitations, the social worker should seek supervision or consultation to manage personal biases and ensure the client receives effective, unbiased care. It may be helpful to document any concerns and engage in self-reflection to mitigate harm.
7. The requirements of the National Association of Social Workers Code of Ethics, which advocate for the rights and dignity of oppressed minority groups, should outweigh personal religious objections in this case. Social workers are ethically bound to ensure that their beliefs do not interfere with providing equitable care to all individuals.
